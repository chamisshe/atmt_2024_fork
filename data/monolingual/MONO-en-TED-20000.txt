Stephen Palumbi: Following the mercury trail
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
That's the theme of my talk.
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.
They say, "You know what you smell?
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now why does that matter for human health?
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
They get into the food chain.
Adult males: a huge load.
Juveniles: a huge load.
Those females, they're not trying to.
That top predator, of course, is us.
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
That's another story.
But some of them were not whale meat at all.
We had these data a few years ago.
These women have toxic breast milk.
That means their immune systems are compromised.
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
Why does that happen?
Often what jams us up is sewage.
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
Copepods are small crustaceans.
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
And he could come in and fix the flow.
Monterey is one of those.
In 1932, that's the picture.
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
It didn't happen accidentally.
Thank you very much.

Jessa Gamble: Our natural sleep cycle
Let's start with day and night.
So, we have this ability as well.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
So, cut to the modern day.

AK: The ancestor of the horse.
Okay, we'll do something with it.
So it needed a very articulate front paw.
But, like all puppets, it has other attributes.
BJ: Breath is really important for us.
Puppets always have to try to be alive.
And in a way that's a metaphor for life.
BJ: His mother was a puppeteer.
I really thought they were so beneath me.
BJ: And here again, you see the same structure.
And he's controlling the ear movement.
AK: It seemed a lovely idea.
BJ: But it had to ride. It had to have a rider.
But they agreed to go along with it for a while.
So we began with a test.
So we made a model.
BJ: And the two manipulators are inside.
And we had a crate built for it.
It had to be shipped to London.
BJ: About 40 people.
AK: We were terrified.
It had by no means got the green light yet.
And so the show was given the green light.
The horses are completely handmade.
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey.
Joey boy, you there?
No, no, I haven't got it.
He's got it; it's in his pocket.
AK: Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey.
Come here. Stand here where people can see you.
Move around. Come on.
Here, Craig is working the head.
Horses' hearing is very important.
It's almost more important than their eyesight.
He's working the leg.
Horses are so unpredictable.
The hind legs have got the same action.
BJ: We had a big challenge with breathing.
AK: Other emotional stuff.
You see the skeletal structure of it.
Again, that was a practical consideration.
It's three heads making one character.
AK: Mikey Brett from Leicestershire.
Thank you. Thank you.
I want to start with these word pairs here.
This report is our main public report.
Now, this may surprise you.
Now we have Wikipedia.
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
GiveIndia is for a whole country.
And it goes on and on.
Take a look at these.
But I'm really hopeful.
We don't have a language for it yet.
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.
But we have a problem.
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
And they were great community leaders.
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.
Whatever that means to you.
What is the story you most want for them to tell?
cars,future,technology
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.
Does this sound familiar to you?
Now, why would we want to do such a thing?
Well, there's two really good reasons for this.
There's another reason as well.
You see, I have a passion for racing.
It's extraordinary to watch.
It has a curve there called the Corkscrew.
Life is way too short for boring cars.
Now watch, he has to downshift.
And then he has to turn left.
Look for the tree, and down.
So watch as John does this here.
Not a challenging task.
In fact, entirely reflexive.
And their actions are fantastic.
What is the ideal balance of human and machine?
And what do I mean by that?
One young woman brought her grandfather.
Now, lets take some data. Facebook.
The first gentleman, he's a baker.
And I've heard this story a number of times.
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.
And now, obviously, they have it open.
So, none of these cases are unique.
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.
But what is really exceptional is the setting.
Maybe you had a direct line.
That was where the focus had to be.
And then the school enacts perfectly well.
This only started about 150 years ago.
And they are doing it massively.
I really think that the number is conservative.
100 percent are using text.
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.

The first one is happening right here in Chicago.
Talk about a sweet beginning.
Now Judy Bonds is a coal miner's daughter.
The water is turned into goo.
Not quite an obvious alliance.
And she might not get to see that mountaintop.
That's what my homegirl is doing.
So I'm so proud of that.
Now they're all very practical visionaries.
I think that number's probably going to go up.
And there are plenty of other examples like that.
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.
The numbers just aren't there.
This is smart infrastructure.
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
These examples indicate a trend.
And we all need to be invested in it.
And I call it "hometown security."
The sum of the local is the global.
See, my dad was a great, great man in many ways.
But, like all of us, he had some problems.
And his was gambling, compulsively.
So you need to help him out.
So I'm not that unhappy about that.
But I really did struggle for financial support.
But I did in fact get married in it.
Hometown security is next on my to-do list.
My career, I mean, I'd done my career.
Didn't have to worry about earning money.
It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks.
Those are conveyor belts that go around.
I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?"
You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.
And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.
Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.
And that's very important, the user interface.
And this is the big difference.
Not something you'd envy or want to do.
The camel smells were unbelievable.
And guess what? We won it hands down.
The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.
And boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.
We thought that was a good time to announce it.
Launched it on the 12 of November.
I want you do something else.
Get your friends to give one, get one.
I won't dwell on the pricing at all.
They went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.

Britta Riley: A garden in my apartment
And some days, that can even be a little scary.
And we have window farms all over the world.
Rodney Brooks says robots will invade our lives
Are they going to be around in 50 years?
Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.
Another one from Karcher.
And let me just show you that.
If it hits something -- you people see that?
It's grown-ups that get really upset.
We'll just put some crap here.
Yeah, OK. So -- we'll leave that for later.
And that's true with a lot of robots.
On board that robot is a PC running Linux.
Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.
That was not a controlled descent.
Now it's going to head off.
Let's run this video.
Nick Robertson has that story.
Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?
The robot's being totally autonomous.
Very hostile environments, 150˚ C, 10,000 PSI.
So now I brought this up in front of him.
Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.
I didn't show you how to do that.
Now see if you can put it back together.
And he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
Good robot, that's good.
So we saw a bunch of things there.
It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.
And it looks for things that move around.
And it looks right at that.
And so these weights change.
Did people see the movie "AI"?
It sees her, pays attention to her.
Can you hear that now, out there?
Do you really think so?
You're such a cute little robot.
RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.
Voice: ...very good, Kismet.
Voice: Look at my smile.
These are naive subjects.
Voice: Hey, Kismet, ah, there it is.
Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.
Voice: No. No. You're not to do that. No.
Not appropriate. No. No.
RB: I'm going to leave it at that.
We put that together. Then we put in turn taking.
When we talk to someone, we talk.
So we put this in the robot.
It was just saying random English phonemes.
I want to show you my watch."
This is another robot, Cog.
Well, do you ever need to give robots respect?
They're just machines, after all.
It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.
They want to take over from us.
But Hollywood extends it to the robots.
I don't think that's going to happen.
And we're just not going to let it go that way.
economics,global issues,politics
And at that moment our economy collapses.
But remember, Greece is there today.
It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.
Why don't we lower both lines?
But that system has tons of problems.
Wealth piles up in the wrong places.
But here's what I learned.
But let me explain what I'm thinking.
They like Social Security. They like Medicare.
Social Security is fairly easy to fix.
Raise medical health care contributions?
We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.
They way outweigh Democrats.
That's a more partisan area.
But that is not the case at all.
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.
And the data is very clear.
Those groups are very, very small.
And that part of it has not changed.
Then you can see radical partisan change.
They don't represent what our views are.
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.
The Fed can't mess it up so badly.
And nothing happened at all.
The fear is that the world is watching.
arts,beauty,design,happiness
Richard Seymour: How beauty feels
But I felt something.
And it was a physiological response.
Now you probably know the answer to this already.
I remember it clearly.
I thought, well what the hell's that about?
So I started to ask myself questions about it.
I thought, well that's not good enough.
And so I did some experiments.
Do you know what it is? Anyone?
And this isn't a think, it's a feel.
And would you do me a favor?
I get a sense of anticipation"?
Now I'm not a neuroscientist.
So how do we make that actually work?
This is one of the most beautiful things I know.
It's a plastic bag.
Look at that. What are you feeling about it?
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?
I'm watching your faces very carefully.
Maybe there's an innocence to it.
Look at that picture.
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.
Is it beautiful now?
Stop. Stop. How do you feel?
Where are you feeling this?
I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.
But what are you doing?
I watch what people do.
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.
It's not a "this is wonderful!"
That's not the expression of joy.
There's something else in that.
There's something weird happening.
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.
It isn't just about nice.
And that's packed in there as well.
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.
Well it obviously isn't.
So it wasn't about symmetry.
But they're both different.
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.
And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.
And this is the F1 MV Agusta.
It's masses and masses of layers.
It's something much bigger.
So that's getting me excited.
And I feel that here.
Titanium lacquer on this.
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.
I'm really getting into this now.
Why would you do that?
So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.
We have to deal with it.
And so look at her.
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.
No one's noticed, have they yet?
Did you see what I did?
I moved three things by a millimeter.
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.
So that's okay, isn't it?
Another millimeter?
And only a few people can do it.
And a focus group cannot do it.
And a team rarely can do it.
So all hail to that.
It's a fantastic example, a simple object.
So we're going to have a little experiment.
Are you ready? Okay.
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.
But you're a slave of that first flash.
It wins or loses at that point.
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.
It's fantastic, isn't it?
Look at that. Do you want to see it again?
You didn't maybe know it.
But how do you feel about it?
Form follows function?
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.
Form is function. Form is function.
atheism,culture,philosophy,religion
Alain de Botton: Atheism 2.0
Now I think it's too easy.
And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
Now what is Atheism 2.0?
I can't believe in the doctrines.
I don't think these doctrines are right.
I really like the art of Mantegna.
I really like looking at old churches.
So that's a sort of tough choice.
I don't think we have to make that choice.
I think there is an alternative.
The secular world is full of holes.
We have secularized badly, I would argue.
And I'd like to run through a few of these today.
I'd like to kick off by looking at education.
That's a lovely idea.
Interesting where it came from.
They asked themselves the following question.
And influential voices came up with one answer.
They wanted to replace scripture with culture.
And that's a very plausible idea.
It's also an idea that we have forgotten.
Why? They don't think we need it.
They see us as adults, rational adults.
What we need is information.
We need data, we don't need help.
We're only just holding it together.
Perhaps this is just me, maybe you.
But anyway, we're only just holding it together.
And we need help. Of course, we need help.
Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.
they'd go, "No, no. I don't need one of those.
I'm an independent, individual person."
Religions go, "Nonsense.
So get on your knees and repeat it."
Otherwise our minds are like sieves.
So religions are cultures of repetition.
We associate repetition with boredom.
"Give us the new," we're always saying.
"The new is better than the old."
Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
All the major religions give us calendars.
What is a calendar?
Now we don't think that way.
I'll just come across it."
Nonsense, says the religious world view.
It sets things into perspective, etc., etc.
You'll be handed rice cakes.
But the religious world doesn't think that way.
And you would go, "Amen, amen, amen."
And we'd know that we had a real rhythm going.
They don't just deliver us sermons on this.
They tell us to have a bath.
We don't tend to do that.
Let's look at art now.
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums, etc.
You've heard that saying.
I couldn't disagree more.
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
And that's what art is.
Essentially it's propaganda.
Now the word "propaganda" sets off alarm bells.
All works of art are talking to us about things.
Art should be didactic.
Let's think of something else.
And they tend to be on their own.
And they don't really change much.
What do organized religions do?
They group together, they form institutions.
And that has all sorts of advantages.
First of all, scale, might.
These are massive machines.
These are all very good qualities.
We recognize them in relation to corporations.
They're selling us shoes and cars.
We need to group together.
And that's what religions do.
That's something we can learn from.
I want to conclude.
Look very closely at pilgrimage.
AB: You can get shot by both sides.
CA: Actually, let me just ask a question.
One wants to say, "Nonsense. Why not?"
And that's really the spirit of my talk.
There's so much we can absorb.
AB: No, we need to be polite about differences.
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.
It's seen as hypocrisy.
It doesn't need it.
I've sketched a sort of broad framework.
So it's a wiki project.
Brewster Kahle builds a free digital library
One is what's on the Boston Public Library.
Carved above their door is, "Free to All."
That's pretty neat.
Then the question is, what do you get?
You know, is it worth trying to get there?
Do you actually want it online?
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.
I like the physical book.
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?
And it turns out to not be very hard.
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.
And they actually come out kind of nice looking.
There are some other bookmobiles running around.
It was quite popularly attended.
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.
We're in good enough shape.
But how do you go about doing all this scanning?
But do things that you love.
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.
People seem to love it.
The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.
We've scanned about 200,000 books.
So all in all, that's going very well.
Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.
So how much is there?
This doesn't make any sense.
But half of those were Indian.
We're not quite a YouTube.
Television comes quite a bit larger.
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.
so we're hedging our bets here.
http://www.ted.com/talks/anil_ananthaswamy.html
And that feeling hasn't left me yet.
And where in the world would you find such water?
This is Lake Baikal.
The lake is entirely frozen.
And they have dedicated their lives to it.
It's very harsh conditions.
They work on a shoestring budget.
And it's that basic, but they do this every year.
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.
An extraordinary set of telescopes.
Here's another view of the same.
Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.
This is cosmology's final frontier.
And here we are about to board our bus.
And that's taking us to McMurdo.
And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.
It's an extraordinary place.
And that process takes about two hours.
The fabric alone weighs two tons.
That's the kind of dedication these people have.
And I would like to share with you a launch.
This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.
And both require silence of some sort.
We all know the Earth is in trouble.
I think that vote is occurring right now.
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.
Mushrooms are very fast in their growth.
Day 21, day 23, day 25.
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.
We share in common the same pathogens.
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.
After they sporulate, they do rot.
And so we see a mushroom here sporulating.
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.
These are little wells.
The mycelium is sentient.
It knows that you are there.
How is that possible?
This was first discovered in 1859.
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.
420 million years ago, this organism existed.
It was called Prototaxites.
All across most land masses.
And these existed for tens of millions of years.
We were involved with several experiments.
The mycelium absorbs the oil.
Some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms.
They're very large.
The last image we don't have.
The entire pile was a green berm of life.
And I'll show you a graph here.
Think of the implications.
as a treatment against consumption.
May not seem that large -- let's get closer.
This is extremely rare fungus.
And a few years ago, we received these results.
10 or greater are considered to be very active.
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.
I did something that nobody else had done.
These are spores -- this is in their spores.
They gave it to the queen.
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.
This has huge implications.
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
It covers over 200,000 species.
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
But watch what happens here.
And we came up with Econol.
These are a species that we need to join with.

Stacey Kramer: The best gift I ever survived
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
It will bring all of your family together.
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
And you'll have a lifetime supply of good drugs.
Your life will have new meaning.
Peace, health, serenity, happiness, nirvana.
$55,000, and that's an incredible deal.
Does Amazon carry it?
Does it have the Apple logo on it?
Is there a waiting list?
This gift came to me about five months ago.
And this, and then this.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
Jane Poynter: Life in Biosphere 2
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.
I mean, what is a biosphere?
But of course none of that happened.
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built.
And it was time for us to go in and give it a go.
We needed to know, is life this malleable?
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
So eight of us went in: four men and four women.
More on that later.
And this is the world that we lived in.
This is the agriculture.
It was essentially an organic farm.
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.
And those sweet potatoes became part of me.
And we knew that we were losing CO2.
And so we were working to sequester carbon.
Good lord -- we know that term now.
We were growing plants like crazy.
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.
And we had no clue where it was.
And we had sleep apnea at night.
And everybody outside thought we were dying.
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.
Not me, that was for sure.
And we did indeed find it.
And we found it in the concrete.
Essentially it had done something very simple.
Pretty straightforward really.
And we proved the concept, more or less.
We all went quite nuts, I will say.
And everybody ran up to me.
And I recoiled. They stank!
And boy do we stink out here.
I had been growing all my own food.
People must have thought I was nuts.
It was really quite astonishing.
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.
This is what I saw.
But this is also what I saw.
And it will produce a food crop.
In this case it was oilseed.
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.
Kyoto Protocol system.
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.
And put your project in that context.
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.
And I think often times people get lost in that.
It's such a huge subject."
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.
It's a certain type of aesthetic.
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
And I threw away my rake.
I've been building topsoil.
And I have an oasis.
This is actually in a riparian area.
The small stuff counts.
The yogis had it right.
It also connects us in time.
health care,medicine
Atul Gawande: How do we heal medicine?
Doctors and medicine made no difference at all.
And there were a few.
This was a life as a craftsman.
Autonomy was our highest value.
We can't cure it all.
But we can make it possible for most.
But what does it take?
We can't do it all by ourselves.
Everyone just has a piece of the care.
We want to say, "This is just the way it is.
This is just what medicine requires."
It's just the way it is.
And what that means is there's hope.
That would be really our only choice.
It's a terrible design strategy actually.
And you put it all together and what do you get?
He didn't see it in his own patients.
and he wanted to get the data.
It took him three months.
They had found a problem.
Which brings us to skill number two a system has.
Skill one, find where your failures are.
Skill two is devise solutions.
Could we design a checklist for surgery?
You have to think about things like pause points.
And then you need to focus on the killer items.
It fell in every hospital it went into.
The death rates fell 47 percent.
This was bigger than a drug.
And it's been slow to spread.
I met an actual cowboy, by the way.
How did you do that?
Even the cowboys are pit crews now.
We all need to be pit crews now.

Dennis vanEngelsdorp: a plea for bees
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.
And bees are very faithful.
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.
However, honeybees are a minority.
We have bumblebees on the top.
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.
And so we need to rethink this idea.
And I encourage you to look at that.
biology,collaboration,science
Stefano Mancuso: The roots of plant intelligence
Some of them are very easy.
Some of them are about the animals, the number.
And this problem is: where are the plants?
This is not the common man.
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.
But it's something completely wrong.
You know very well about professors.
Let's have a look at this short movie now.
We have David Attenborough.
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.
This is a very fast movement.
Some of them are much more sophisticated.
But they are also able to sleep.
This is one, Mimosa pudica.
It's a kind of vegetarian experimentation.
They communicate with other plants.
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.
This is a serious business.
How is it possible to do this without a brain?
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."
This is not a metaphor.
Now, this is a root apex growing against a slope.
We have almost 14 million roots.
They work in the same way.
And why are they so similar?
We have the androids that are inspired by man.
But why have we not any plantoid?
It's much more easy to build hybrids.
Well, thank you for your attention.

A whistleblower you haven't heard
That was whistling.
I'm trying to do this in English.
So I whistled along with him.
I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom.
I whistled on [my] bike. I whistled everywhere.
But it can also sound like this.
And I just couldn't.
So, okay, I'm going to America.
I would love to, but why?
So I immediately called her up, of course.
She didn't expect me to go there.
And I would have lost my face.
I don't know if that's correct English.
And she thought, "He will never go there."
But actually I did.
That was great fun, of course.
Then I couldn't participate for a few years.
So I quit my day job as a nurse.
Okay, I'm not the only one whistling here.
You say, "Huh, what do you mean?"
Well actually, you are going to whistle along.
Why? Can I go away?"
Actually it's very simple.
It's about 80 minutes long.
No, no, no. It's four minutes long.
So I whistle the tone.
Sorry. I forgot one thing.
You whistle the same tone as me.
I heard a wide variety of tones.
This is very promising.
I'll ask the technicians to start the music.
I'm so sorry, technicians.
I'm so used to that.
It's easy, isn't it?
Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself.
Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.

Charlie Todd: The shared experience of absurdity
Now this took place in January of 2002.
And this woman is the star of the video.
She doesn't know she's being filmed.
She's being filmed with a hidden camera.
This is on the 6 train in New York City.
And this is the first stop along the line.
And that's me right there in a brown coat.
It's about 30 degrees outside.
I'm wearing a hat. I'm wearing a scarf.
And the girl's going to notice me right here.
And as you'll see now, I'm not wearing pants.
One person's not that unusual.
They're going to be entering this car one by one.
We'll act as though we don't know each other.
So the video won't show everything.
This goes on for another four stops.
So that's a still from the video there.
And I love that girl's reaction so much.
And we've continued to do it every year.
So I could do more large-scale projects.
So I got inspired by that.
This was completely unauthorized.
We didn't let the stores know we were coming.
And I stood in the park giving signals.
You'll see that start right here.
And then we had dancing. We had everyone dance.
There were several other activities.
There's a better photo of it.
So here's the video.
So again, this is 2005.
This is the Best Buy in New York City.
But also, don't shop.
Just stand around and don't face products."
Everybody else is one of our actors.
You can see them in this footage.
And one morning, I was riding the subway.
It's morning rush hour.
It's very cold outside.
And of course they don't.
You know, as kids, we're taught to play.
It's just acceptable that play is a good thing.
We don't need a reason.
Dan Dennett's response to Rick Warren
It's wonderful to be back.
I love this wonderful gathering.
And you must be wondering, "What on Earth?
Have they put up the wrong slide?"
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?
And you might say, "Well, God designed the cow."
But, of course, God got a lot of help.
This is the ancestor of cattle.
Now why am I talking about cows?
Religions are natural phenomena.
They're just as natural as cows.
They have evolved over millennia.
They have a biological base, just like the Oryx.
This is TED, and I want to talk about design.
And that is the spell that I want to break.
Here's my proposal.
But also let them know about other religions.
Now why do I say that?
Misinformed consent is not worth it.
It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count really.
Democracy depends on informed consent.
They don't own them.
You can't own your children.
It strikes me as practically libertarian.
All I'm saying is -- facts. Facts only.
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."
But now I'm going to move on.
That's the steward.
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.
They depend on us for their survival.
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.
There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!
Think of what this got them.
"How clever of sheep!" you might say.
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.
They were clueless.
But it was a very clever move.
Whose clever move was it?
It was a clever move of natural selection itself.
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
And why was the ant doing it?
It was sort of a spooky story.
And I think some people may have misunderstood.
Lancet flukes aren't smart.
They're not really bright. They don't have to be.
It doesn't have to be.
That's the way evolution works.
The question -- was domestication good for sheep?
It was great for their genetic fitness.
Here's what he said.
That was just 10,000 years ago.
Yesterday, in biological terms.
That is what we have done on this planet.
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards.
We now wield the paintbrush."
And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.
And how can we do that?
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.
They would be puzzled by many things.
Anybody know what this is?
I'll tell you what it is.
Here's a big crowd.
Here's another crowd in Mecca.
Martians would be amazed by this.
Actually, I'm going to pass over this.
The ant isn't alone.
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species.
Does that ever happen to us?
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
But I'm not just talking about Islam.
I'm talking also about Christianity.
Same idea! Well, not quite.
I'll give you a few quotes.
"The heart of worship is surrender.
Those words are by Rick Warren.
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
You've all got a copy.
You've just heard the man.
First of all, the goal.
And you heard just now what the goal is.
He's absolutely right.
I give him an A+ on this.
Is the goal achieved?
30 million copies of this book.
Al Gore, eat your heart out.
This is a fantastic achievement.
And, the means -- how does he do it?
I don't have to tell you this.
Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood.
I really appreciated that.
Just enough repetition.
That's really important.
And now we come to my problem.
But I wish it were better.
I have some problems with the book.
That's worth mentioning.
Now, I just do not believe that.
But that is just a difference of opinion.
That's not what I'm really worried about.
I'm not happy with that sentiment at all.
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.
And here I think, "Wait a minute."
Is he endorsing creationism here?"
And you can't tell.
I think that's false.
Now maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."
There might be some way of treating that as true.
Whose truth are we going to listen to?
And here's one that does concern me.
And that's a problem.
"Don't ever argue with the Devil.
Now Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.
It's a very clever adaptation of religions.
"You don't like my interpretation?
You've got a reasonable objection to it?
Don't listen, don't listen!
That's the Devil speaking."
I've got one more problem, then I'm through.
Here's one, not as beautiful as the others.
It simply shows the religions of the world.
A very clever little meme.
So, I wish we could drop this meme.
I wish this meme would go extinct.
Thanks very much for your attention.

Julian Treasure: Shh! Sound health in 8 steps
Incidentally, we see just one octave.
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.
They work even when you sleep.
Ears are made not for hearing, but for listening.
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
Here are two of them.
Reductive listening is listening "for."
Men typically listen reductively.
So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
That's the way we talk, right guys?
Women typically listen expansively.
Noise kills 200,000 people a year in Europe.
It's a really big problem.
It looks a bit like this.
There is a cost of compression.
You're having to imagine it.
It's not good for you in the long run.
Now that's a really serious problem.
Protect your ears in that way.
Silence is beautiful.
It's fun to get into designing with sound.
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.
It's been around for thousands of years.
I do urge you to explore this.
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.
First of all, listen consciously.
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.
You can do this in groups as well.
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.
So I urge you to take that path.
I wish you sound health.
Janna Levin: The sound the universe makes
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.
We see light reflected off the Moon.
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky.
We can't see them directly.
They destroy stars around them.
They churn up debris in their surroundings.
But they won't come to us directly through light.
Now even light will be bent by those paths.
These are the natural curves in space.
And even light could not escape this current.
He did not believe they existed in nature.
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.
It's actually not massive enough.
But basically that's what we're talking about.
It cannot hide behind the black hole.
So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.
This was one of the groups.
You would literally hear the sound.
If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.
And we can predict what the sound will be.
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.
It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.
This is another sound from my group.
Want to get away from the sound.
Both black holes are moving.
Both black holes are getting closer together.
In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.
And then they're going to merge.
Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.
In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.
They look like they're frozen in some embrace.
But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.
It might make a sound.
So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.
We weren't even here.
It's like hurry, build your instruments.
It's getting closer and closer, and in 20 ...
It's a terrible sound.
It's literally the definition of noise.
It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.
I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?
Will it happen again?
Here's my multiverse creatures.
Nalini Nadkarni: Life science in prison
Trees epitomize stasis.
You might have a guess.
And our prison system itself is stuck.
That number is rising.
That, I think, is movement.
It cannot be consciously a contributor.
It has to totally surrender.
That implies a lot of trust.
It doesn't know even the word "violation."
To be compassionate is not a joke.
It's not that simple.
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.
The self: you are self-aware.
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.
Thank God we are empathetic.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
Each one has got two games.
It can be anybody's game.
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.
And this guy has to come to the net.
That's human heart.
No human heart is denied of that empathy.
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.
Compassion is not defined in one form.
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
Why? Because it is there in everybody.
It's experienced by people occasionally.
You can't say, "Please love me."
Love is something you discover.
I will come to it later.
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.
It has got to be you.
Maybe the swami is right.
Then everything becomes meaningful.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
Compassion is going to be limited.
Everything is going to be limitless.
You express yourself because you have compassion.
You learn swimming by swimming.
My predecessor meant that.
You have to act it out.
You have to act compassionately.
That's interesting to me.
You act compassionately.
That is where you fake.
You fake it and make it.
If you know how to pray, pray.
Ask for compassion.
Let me act compassionately.
With these words, thank you very much.
Shirin Neshat: Art in exile
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
Politics have defined our lives.
We are there to take pride and insist on respect.
Our artists are at risk.
We are in a position of danger.
We pose a threat to the order of the government.
Culture is a form of resistance.
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
For me, this became incredibly important.
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
So my art became slightly more critical.
My knife became a little sharper.
And I fell into a life in exile.
I am a nomadic artist.
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
Now I am making films.
It's a magical realist novel.
These are some of the images of the coup.
The challenge I have is how to do that.
They're absolutely inspirational for me.
They have confronted the authority.
And once again, they proved themselves.

They don't seem to be of our creation.
They don't seem to be under our control.
I went in to see her.
So I said, "What sort of things?"
A man who turns towards me and smiles.
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
Then, one night, the scene changes.
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.
They come to a certain point and then stop.
Then it changes again.
I said, "Is this like a dream?"
She said, "It's got color. It's got motion.
But it's completely silent, like a silent movie."
And she said that it's a rather boring movie.
And she has a sense of humor.
She knew it was a hallucination.
She had no control over them.
And she didn't know what was going on.
Well, I examined her carefully.
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"
She said, "Did he have them himself?"
Well, so I did tell the nurses.
Now this, for me, is a common situation.
I work in old-age homes, largely.
His grandfather had these hallucinations.
His grandfather was a magistrate, an elderly man.
He'd had cataract surgery.
His vision was pretty poor.
And he knew it was a hallucination.
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
And then the handsome young men disappeared.
They don't usually fade in and out.
They are rather sudden, and they change suddenly.
That was the only figure he recognized.
And you start to see things.
She had very mobile hallucinations as well.
A lot of them had to do with a car.
And, above all, she would see cartoons.
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.
And these frightened her.
Well, what is going on with these people?
They seduce you. They humiliate you.
You interact with them.
You're at a particular road junction.
You smell chestnuts roasting.
And you're waiting for your girl.
And it's that Tuesday evening back in 1982.
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different.
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
So, what is going on?
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
I had to bring it in.
And now it's in there somewhere.
Suddenly this, and suddenly that.
"Kermit means nothing to me."
Well, I've more or less said what I wanted.
Think of the number of blind people.
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
Well, yeah, a lot of them.
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
But they stop there.
CA: And they don't disturb you?
Thank you so much for sharing.
OS: Thank you. Thank you.
Notice, this is an aldehyde, and it's an alcohol.
A galaxy. Hey, there's another galaxy.
Oh look, there's another galaxy.
The first was the feedback from my cousins.
And these are just a few.
And let's pause here.
This clearly was helping people.
We could not believe it.
But I was excited, so I kept going.
Assuming he was good. We don't know.
It's good for motivated students.
It's good for maybe home schoolers."
But then I started getting letters from teachers.
Now they're actually interacting with each other.
The ones I started were much more primitive.
This is a more competent version of it.
And the Khan Academy videos are there.
You can't quite stop.
You're an 80 percent bicyclist."
Stay on that bicycle. Fall off that bicycle.
But we do expect mastery.
This is just another one of the modules.
This is trigonometry.
This is shifting and reflecting functions.
And they all fit together.
We have about 90 of these right now.
It's like one plus one is equal to two.
It'll change what happens at the dinner table.
Every row is a student.
Every column is one of those concepts.
Green means the student's already proficient.
Red means they're stuck.
and all of the rest.
Red is wrong, blue is right.
They watched the video right over there.
They also got faster.
The height is how long it took them.
Maybe they should be tracked differently.
Maybe we should put them in different classes."
And we're seeing it over and over and over again.
Now 100 percent of their time is.
But this is all one system.
Tell me what you're thinking there.
It's actually been pretty interesting.
SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.
And they're doing it at the district level.
It's not an only-in-school thing.
And we can track everything.
So we made that focus diagram.
So it's all been teacher-driven.
It's been pretty crazy.
BG: Is this ready for prime time?
SK: Yeah, it's ready.
BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.
But yeah, it's all there.
BG: Well, it's amazing.
But mostly I'm entranced by it.
This is the first time it has ever been recorded.
The flash is like a scream for help.
It's got a light organ under its eye.
It's got a chin barbel.
The light organs under the eyes are flashing.
That chin barbel is flashing.
This blinds or distracts the predator.
They're things like this.
This is a golden coral, a bush.
It grows very slowly.
The other reason is this amazing bush glows.
And you see things like this.
And these are flytrap anemones.
Now if you poke it, it pulls in its tentacles.
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy.
There are starfish that can make light.
But we have no idea why it does that.
Here's another one. This is also a sea pen.
It's got a brittle star hitching a ride.
It's a green saber of light.
If I squeeze the tip, they go from tip to base.
This is an optical lure that I've used.
We call it the electronic jellyfish.
So the camera's black and white.
It's not high-resolution.
There's something small there that responds.
We're talking to something.
And this was very consistent.
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet.
But the cool thing is, we're talking to it.
We don't know what we're saying.
Personally, I think it's something sexy.
That's a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark.
And this is a burglar alarm.
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon.
But we did see a bunch of responses like this.
This guy is a little more contemplative.
"Hey, wait a minute.
There's supposed to be something else there."
He's thinking about it.
But he's persistent.
He keeps coming back.
We need more eyes on the process.
But I warn you, it's addictive.

Drew Berry: Animations of unseeable biology
Now molecules are really, really tiny.
And by tiny, I mean really.
One way around this is to draw pictures.
And this idea is actually nothing new.
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon.
So this is a transection through blood.
And those red molecules are hemoglobin.
What would it look like?
And that's how I really began. So let's begin.
This is DNA in its classic double helix form.
This was work from a number of years ago.
So again, we begin with DNA.
It's packaged up and bundled up.
All this field of view is a single strand of DNA.
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome.
And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute.
So we're not going to be able to do that today?
No, I'm being told, "No."
The nuclear envelope breaks down.
And then the cell splits down the middle.
So again, here we are at that equator moment.
The chromosomes line up.
So this is a single chromosome.
One is bundled up into one sausage.
It is a signal broadcasting system.
It's also an attention sensing system.
And it's walked away down the microtubules.
It's molecular clockwork.
This is how you work at the molecular scale.
Howard Rheingold: The new power of collaboration
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
Evolution is speeding up.

Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.

So this one was taken around five.
So that's the Flickr photo, that's our imagery.
OK, notice there's now a roof above us.
We're inside the Pike Place Market.
All right, guys, are you there?
All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.
I'm live. All right. There we go.
So they're broadcasting this live.
Because I want to show points of interest.
No, no. The other way.
I don't want to see you guys yet.
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.
We're doing two different things here.
One of them is to take that real ...
And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.
Thank you all very much.
No, they are full of misery.
I'll never do it again."
And he came one day back to campus.
He was working in a big bank.
He stayed late at night every day.
And the guy was deeply depressed.
We'll pay you three dollars for it."
If they said yes, we gave them another one.
This was what we called the meaningful condition.
People built one Bionicle after another.
There was another condition.
And if they said yes, they built it.
People were building Bionicles for a few cents.
But even the small meaning made a difference.
Now we had another version of this experiment.
There was one other piece of data we looked at.
What happened in the Sisyphic condition?
In that condition the correlation was zero.
We basically eliminated it.
And everybody raised their hand.
And they came up with all kinds of ideas.
The next experiment was slightly different.
And people did the first sheet.
And we had three conditions.
So you take a piece, you just put it on the side.
What happened in those three conditions?
And this is basically the result we had before.
But what about the ignored condition?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder.
Now there's good news and bad news here.
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there.
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA.
I put things in the wrong way.
I can't say enjoy those pieces.
I can't say I enjoy the process.
And there's an old story about cake mixes.
But it turns out they were very unpopular.
People did not want them.
Maybe the taste was not good.
No, the taste was great.
No, no, no, it was somebody else's cake.
It was as if you bought it in the store.
It didn't really feel like your own.
So what did they do?
Now you had to break the eggs and add them.
Now it was your cake. Now everything was fine.
We asked people to build some origami.
How much do you want to pay for it?"
And we had two types of people.
Which one of those two is correct?
We tried to make it more difficult.
So for some people we gave the same task.
For some people we just eliminated that.
So now this was tougher. What happened?
Why? Because now the builders loved it even more.
They put all this extra effort into it.
And evaluators? They loved it even less.
Now think about kids.
Your memories and associations and so on.
But imagine this was slightly different.
And you played with them for a few hours.
How much would you pay for them now?
Most people say not that much.
Those are really tough.
Let me say one last comment.
He gave an example of a pin factory.
Is efficiency still more important than meaning?
I think the answer is no.
Sophal Ear: Escaping the Khmer Rouge
And we're actually Cambodians.
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.
Video: April 17th, 1975.
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.
But not just that, they actually banned money.
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.
And he didn't speak Vietnamese.
So he died actually, in January 1976.
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.
And then onwards to Chau Doc.
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.
But for us it meant freedom.
I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.
She's here today with us in the audience.
Jung in Afghanistan -- you get the picture.
Yet, there is hope.
So, doctors prescribe medication.
No one can survive alone.
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.
And partly this is already happening.
But let me repeat the words of the woman.
So the key here is empathy.
Somebody has to feel how you felt.
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.
But, of course, I needed help and funds.
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.
And 70 percent regained their lives.
And they are working with me up to today.
And I would like to share one short vignette.
So I believe this kept me running.
I thank you for your attention.

Nicholas Negroponte, in 1984, makes 5 predictions
Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.
And my favorite example is always fingers.
I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.
Now, what are some of the other advantages?
What we did stumble across was something ...
maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.
But this is the interesting part.
So all we have is this record.
In fact, they funded it for that very reason.
You're going to sort of breathe life into it.
We are so used to doing monologues.
So, book writing is the same thing.
One is that this book knows about itself.
That's one kind of use of random access.
And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.
We highlight the text as we go through the movie.
And the child said, "No, I can't."
And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?"
And it really meant something to the child.
Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.
Reading and writing is utterly useless.
I will come to my last example and then quit.

Eric Dishman: Take health care off the mainframe
All right? That's the first time.
We call these behavioral markers.
So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.
Behavioral markers matter.
How do we change behavior?
This is some of the field work that we've done.
We study people in Rochester, New York.
Why is Intel willing to fund that?
It was right around New Years.
This is a map of the entire world.
And in fact, it's upon us.
She was born one second after midnight in 1946.
I just extended it."
You know, this is the mainframe.
This is the first general hospital in Vienna.
Now, I'm not anti-hospital.
And this is mainframe healthcare.
We are obsessed with this way of thinking.
The first word that comes up is "doctor."
This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.
It's population-based.
We've got to focus on the home.
She tripped over her oxygen tank.
Boomers will press the button. Trust me.
I have access to senators and CEOs.
I can't stop this from happening.
It's a research platform.
That's sort of the state of the art.
Here's what some of this data might look like.
This is actually sensor firings.
These are two different subjects in our study.
It's about a year's worth of data.
Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.
So, 10,000 households or bust.
It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.
But there is no goal within this health reform.
It's just a mess today.
So, you know, that's my last message to you.
Tristram Stuart: The global food waste scandal
I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.
And that's what I came up with.
We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
Supermarkets are an easy place to start.
I certainly haven't.
So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go?
It's called sheep's organs.
I was sitting in a roadside cafe.
How have I insulted my host?"
This guy has thrashed me at my own game."
In our homes, we've lost touch with food.
This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?
The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
I answered that question when I was 15.
It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.
It's also a massive saving of resources.
We knew that during the war.
Stop wasting food. Thank you very much.

Jack Horner: Building a dinosaur from a chicken
I was very fortunate early in my career.
In fact, I don't read much of anything.
But instead, I go out and I find things.
Then I just pick things up.
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
You all know the story, right.
And everybody's happy about that.
And they're happy over and over again.
And then, then, then, and then ...
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
So that's what we've done.
And so she thought, well, what the heck.
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
And we did find a lot of stuff.
But this one died at the age of 16.
But Mary went further.
She took the bone, and she dumped it into acid.
But there was something left.
There were blood vessels left.
There were flexible, clear blood vessels.
It was extraordinary.
We thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast.
And we did. We got better material.
The cells looked better.
The vessels looked better.
Found the protein collagen.
I mean, it was wonderful stuff.
But it's not dinosaur DNA.
But birds are dinosaurs.
Birds are living dinosaurs.
We actually classify them as dinosaurs.
Avian dinosaurs are our modern birds.
I know, you're as bad as the sixth-graders.
The sixth-graders look at it and they say, "No."
"The chicken is not."
So this is our problem, as you can imagine.
The chicken is a dinosaur.
I mean it really is.
But the sixth-graders demand it.
We'll call them biological modification tools.
And we know selection works.
Or any of the other funny-looking little dogs.
We also have transgenesis.
Transgenesis is really cool too.
That's how people make GloFish.
And that's pretty cool.
I guess we could make a glow chicken.
But there's another thing.
There's what we call atavism activation.
Snakes are occasionally born with legs.
And here's an example.
This is a chicken with teeth.
Now that's a good characteristic.
We can save that one.
We know we can use that.
We can make a chicken with teeth.
That's getting closer.
That's better than a glowing chicken.
He's looking for those genes as well.
And so that's what we're looking into.
It has the three fingers, the three digits.
And so what we're looking for is that gene.
And the same goes for the tails.
Birds have basically rudimentary tails.
So that's the other gene we're looking for.
We want to stop that tail from resorbing.
It's a cooler-looking chicken.
But it's just the very basics.
So that really is what we're doing.
And people always say, "Why do that?
Why make this thing?
Well, that's a good question.
Internet,computers,technology
Actually, it's deceptively large.
Obviously a very small community.
It was incredibly successful.
I'll come back to that later.
So for a few hours, it all passed through China.
That will not succeed.
Nobody has claimed credit for that.
Everything started breaking.
Now, of course you couldn't do that today.
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now.
It's basically a matter of deciding to do it.
It's not that hard a problem.
Many things have been said about this.
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.
This issue isn't just theoretical.

Jim Toomey: Learning from Sherman the shark
Cartoons are basically short stories.
Not all of them have happy endings.
So how did I get started cartooning?
So you have to make a living cartooning.
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
This is some of my early work.
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
It's just a big blue surface.
This part's not going to be on the test."
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.
I saw forests and meadows.
And best of all, I saw the animals.
It would start a whole new space race.
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.
For instance, take these sea turtles.
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.
Or take this sea cucumber.
He's like an underwater Spiderman.
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.
Try and inflate it.
Or take this swordfish.
Or this lionfish for instance.
He's a great white shark.
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.
He's kind of just out there making a living.
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.
He never seems to settle on any particular girl.
So with characters, you can make stories.
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.
I did another story on marine debris.
Plastic just is not going to do it."
We sort of worked things out.
I couldn't fit them in.
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.
It's cruel, it's wasteful.
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.
Ostensibly, he's dead now.
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
Sherman's up in shark heaven.
This is what I love about comic strips, you know.
You can kind of do anything.
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
And he clicks the "buy now" button.
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.
You've been given one tool, a hammer.
And you take the piece out into the daylight.
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.
And you hear other people doing the same thing.
And then some yells, "Stop!"
And they turn up the lights.
And that's what we're doing with the ocean.
That's why I like what I do.
Thanks for listening.
This is actually a story of my own backyard.
There was no one to relate publicly to.
For them, the Headwaters is a kitchen.
The Tahltan need your help. We need your help.

Arthur Benjamin does "Mathemagic"
Well, good morning ladies and gentlemen.
I -- was -- your hand go up?
Now bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?
I see, I see one way in the back.
How about a two-digit number?
For instance, five squared would be?
So quickly, a two-digit number please.
AB: 37 squared, OK.
AB: 23 squared, OK.
AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?
Woman: 1369. AB: 1369.
AB: Thank you very much.
Let me try to take this one step further.
Anyone I point to, call out a three-digit number.
Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.
Just give some indication if it's right.
A three-digit number, sir, yes?
AB: 987 squared is 974,169.
AB: 457 squared is 205,849.
OK, another, another three-digit number, sir?
AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041.
Yes? One more three-digit number please.
AB: 722 is 500 -- ooh, that's a harder one.
162 squared is 26,244.
Audience: Seven. AB: Seven.
Audience: Five. AB: Five.
Audience: Eight. AB: Eight.
Eight-digit capacity -- don't you hate that?
AB: Does yours go higher?
Man: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later.
Would you each enter that on your calculator?
How many digits do you have, six or seven?
Seven, and yours? Woman: Seven.
Woman: One, OK, 197042.
AB: Did you leave out the number 6?
Woman: Yes, AB: Good, OK, that's one.
AB: I think you left out the number 3?
OK, any six of them.
Really scramble them up this time, please.
AB: Did you leave out the number 7?
AB: 1953, and the month?
Audience: November. AB: November what?
AB: 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes.
OK, it's -- how about you, what year?
Audience: 1949. AB: 1949, and the month?
Audience: October. AB: October what?
AB: Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?
Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959.
AB: 1959, OK -- and the month?
Audience: February.
AB: February what? Audience: Sixth.
AB: Sixth -- was that a Friday? Audience: Yes.
Good, how about the person behind her?
Call -- call -- what year was it?
Audience: 1947. AB: 1947, and the month?
Audience: May. AB: May what?
We can do it that way.
I brought with me a book of calendars.
What year was it, first of all?
Audience: April. AB: April what?
Can you confirm, Chris?
What year, Chris, would you like?
And what month? CA: June.
AB: June what? CA: Sixth.
AB: Sixth -- was that a Sunday?
CA: It was. AB: And it was cloudy.
Good, thank you very much.
Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy?
Audience: Six. AB: Six.
Audience: Three. AB: Three.
57,683 squared. Yuck.
Let me explain what that is.
So, without any more stalling, here we go.
38,931; double that to get 77,862.
That seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you.

Clifford Stoll on ... everything
I'm delighted to be here.
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
So I'm not going to talk about that.
The second time, it's engineering.
A third time, it's just being a technician.
So, I'm not going to talk about that.
My idea is: no! No!
So don't go back and read my dissertation.
It probably has lies in it as well.
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.
But to me, things aren't the future.
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.
This is a Klein bottle.
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
It has wonderful properties.
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.
That was a month of my life.
Could somebody put this guy up?
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
And it sent me back.
This guy over here of course is me.
In the background, my bicycle.
So I think locally and I act locally.
Put your money where you mouth is."
Not just showing up every now and then.
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.
Not just show up to class every now and then.
No calculus, I'll cut out that.
You won't need to know trig.
We're going to be doing genuine physics."
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.
And there's no time to do it.
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!
Right? This is simple physics.
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?
And that constant is the speed of sound.
I've got a frequency counter right here.
Now, so I know the frequency.
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.
Let's figure out what this is.
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.
This cop comes after me with a rifle.
He wants to clunk me over the head!
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.
The cop's chasing me.
Chases me into this room.
The entranceway to the bell tower.
I keep climbing up, go back.
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"

Graham Hill: Less stuff, more happiness
So where does this lead?
It's actually a great way to save you some money.
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft.
instead of 600, immediately I'm saving 200 grand.
So how can you live little?
Three main approaches.
First of all, you have to edit ruthlessly.
We've got to clear the arteries of our lives.
And that shirt that I hadn't worn in years?
It's time for me to let it go.
We need to think before we buy.
Secondly, our new mantra: small is sexy.
We want space efficiency.
My office folds away, easily hidden.
And of course, my own movie theater.
But consider the benefits of an edited life.
Go from 3,000 to 2,000, from 1,500 to 1,000.
Would that give me a little more freedom?
Maybe a little more time?"
It doesn't really matter.
I know I don't need it.
Maybe, just maybe, less might equal more.
So let's make room for the good stuff.
Stuart Brown says play is more than fun
So, here we go: a flyby of play.
Seriously, but dangerously fun.
And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."
You see any adults?
Well, lets go back to the 15th century.
All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.
And something very unusual happens.
And they begin an incredible ballet.
They're in a state of play.
Now how did I get involved in this?
Charles Whitman was his name.
This is a mountain goat.
They got together -- JPL hired them.
So play is practical, and it's very important.
But it has to be safe exploration.
If you want to belong, you need social play.
Rough and tumble play.
I'm telling you a story today about play.
So what does play do for the brain?
I walked into the Carnegie asking for a grant.
Nothing lights up the brain like play.
The animal world has objectified it.
They both hide out.
The non-players never come out -- they die.
Now, this is a consequence of play deprivation.
And we all have capacity to play signal.
And you can trust it.
I think we've got a lot of learning to do.
And therefore, the most playful.
And this gives us a leg up on adaptability.
And so he followed up on it.
This is our maiden voyage in this.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
The Wearable Meeting.
So people know that it's there.
JH: Stuart Brown, thank you very much.
Alisa Miller shares the news about the news
How does the news shape the way we see the world?
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
So, why don't we hear more about the world?
The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
And what about the web?
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
I know we can do better.
And can we afford not to? Thank you.

BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.
BR: That's not it, though.
So this is a plate of nachos.
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.
And why is it delicious?
They're hard to just get automatically.
So the key now is to make it behave like tuna.
But where is this going?
So here's the next challenge.
Nathan Wolfe's jungle search for viruses
This is a picture of a central African hunter.
It's actually a fairly common picture.
We collect blood from them, other specimens.
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.
Their names are Patrice and Patee.
The animals are simply gone.
We stop for a drink of water.
Then there is a rustle in the brush.
I'm going to be talking about this.
Why did we not find some other solution to this?
OK, take a look at his shirt.
You know, take a look at his face.
But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.
Needless to say, I was drastically wrong.
This is challenging work to do.
Which -- which he did, which he did.
Just a few quick before and after shots.
This was our laboratory before.
This is what it looks like now.
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.
We made a number of discoveries.
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.

Golan Levin makes art that looks back at you
Hello! My name is Golan Levin.
Where's art? I got productivity. I got sports.
So I write software. And that's how I do it.
And he said one of them is called Maluma.
And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?
Anyone want to hazard a guess?
Maluma is on top. Yeah. So.
And they sort of fly away, out of your head.
So let's bring up a video of that.
And it's almost impossible to perform.
The full videos are online if you are interested.
I see subtitles all the time on television."
And what could it do if it could look back at us?
So let's run this and see if it works.
Okay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video.
Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay.
And if I get really far away I'm blurry.
So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.
Alright. Let's leave that.
It's called Opto-Isolator.
So it blinks one second after you do.
It's an eight-foot snout, with a googly eye.
It helps to have good friends.
It's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"
"Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright.
Checking him out ...
For you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes.
Those are its targets.
Hollywood does this all the time, of course.
Evan Williams on listening to Twitter users
It's a normal everyday thing.
But it wasn't just individuals.
Politicians have recently begun Twittering.
As have this guy's.
Another is via the API.
Summize built a Twitter search engine.
This really changed how we perceived Twitter.
Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.
So, look, if we could have this screen live ...
It's totally intimidating.
So, this would be the Twitter search screen.
Let's type a couple of random words into Twitter.
For example: "Evan Williams."
"... currently listening to Evan Williams."
Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks.
So, thank you very much, Evan.
That was very interesting. EW: Thank you.
Chimamanda Adichie: The danger of a single story
I had never been outside Nigeria.
But that is another story.
Things changed when I discovered African books.
I started to write about things I recognized.
My father was a professor.
My mother was an administrator.
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
Their poverty was my single story of them.
My American roommate was shocked by me.
Now, I've laughed every time I've read this.
My characters drove cars.
They were not starving.
Therefore they were not authentically African.
A few years ago, I visited Mexico from the U.S.
I remember first feeling slight surprise.
And then I was overwhelmed with shame.
I did not have a single story of America.
All of these stories make me who I am.
They make one story become the only story.
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.
Many stories matter.

It's Monday morning.
This is no exaggeration.
The results were quite extraordinary.
It literally flat-lined.
But experts do get things wrong.

This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.
What is the evidence upon which this is based?
What has your investigation focused on?
And what has it ignored?
But we need to go even further.

And reading is just about impossible.
That all seems like win to me.

I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.

Richard Dawkins on militant atheism
Can you understand my quaint English accent?
Don't be fooled. There's nothing new about ID.
People like me, on the other hand, rock the boat.
It's not a thing I often do, so listen carefully.
I think they're right about one thing.
But that's putting it too negatively.
The God theory is not just a bad theory.
You're just not. Why not? Because you're not.
Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.
That's inconceivable, of course.
Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.
This is one nation under God."
He really meant it.
What would Thomas Jefferson have said?
In practice, what is an atheist?
Well, so much for quantity. How about quality?
And I've already hinted what that something is.
Again, I fear it will cost money.
And again, it will need money.
You think we might have grown up since then.
Hence the phrase, "tooth fairy agnostic."
The onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.
So, how about "humanist"?
We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.
Well, here's how it changed me.
Let's all stop being so damned respectful.
Shai Agassi's bold plan for electric cars
So how would you run a whole country without oil?
It never left my brain.
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.
So that is not going to be the path to go.
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?
And not from the power of an edict down.
The network has two components in them.
But you never want to get stuck.
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.
What is the cost of that battery?
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.
You have the crude oil.
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.
And so it's sort of a mini well.
You, today, buy gasoline miles.
And we created electric miles.
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.
That is an 80 cent gallon.
Now this would have been a wonderful paper.
Peres thought that was a great idea.
We sent letters to all the car companies.
He said hybrids are like mermaids.
We then decided to scale it up.
It's inversely proportional to taxes.
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.
We decided to come into the U.S.
It's called the other car.
Why is this a big issue?
Now we're running a stimulus package.
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.
What happens when the economy recovers?
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.
That is another 25 million barrels a day.
That's all the U.S. usage today.
We take our money and we give it away.
You know what happens at that point?
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.
That won't do much difference.
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.
We have 10 million cars by region.
That's an enormous amount of cars.
We have all these regions.
We don't have the industry set right.
Now where is the car industry on that?
No infrastructure, no problem.
We forgot about the entire chain around us.
All this stuff that happens around.
And some of it will go back to the car maker.
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"
These are perfect matches to one another.
That's one percent a year.
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.
One car emits four tons.
And what would it do to our economy?
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.
We have to make the right moral decision.
We have to make it immediately.
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
This is the Africa of opportunity.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
I want to tell you that.
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
You had to do everything to get your phone.
So the market is there.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
We are doing the same with the insurance sector.
So it's clear that things are changing.
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
So I invite you to explore the opportunities.

Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
Well, here's the dirty little secret.
So let's explore how vaccines work.
So that's really how vaccines work.
The virus is defeated.
Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?
So let's take a look at the flu virus.
Now let's take a look at HIV.
Now, what does this mean?
So what we've got is a situation.
So think of it this way.
And that would create a universal HIV vaccine.
Let me give you another example.
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.
These are largely hidden from the immune system.
So I want you to think back a few months ago.
Vaccines were promised to developing countries.
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...
Almost nothing has changed.
So, here's an alarming thought.
What if that wild bird flies by again?
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918?
With a range of new technologies, we could.
Now think of where this leads us.
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
So, the science is changing.
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.
CA: And malaria's even further behind?
The world needs people like you. Thank you.
Stewart Brand on squatter cities
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.
The question is, why?
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.
And here's the second punch line.
Now we're shining right back up.
Al Gore on averting climate crisis
Put yourselves in my position!
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.
There was no motorcade back there.
You've heard of phantom limb pain?
There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
I was going to talk about information ecology.
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
Not quite there yet.
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.
It is easier than you think. It really is.
Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this.
A lot more to be said about that.
We have to buy a lot of those ads.
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
This is the ocean as I used to know it.
First, just a little bit about me.
It's like you dipped a marble in water.
Carbon dioxide level has gone up and up and up.
We're warming the climate.
So this really matters.
And they can handle water.
They can handle a hurricane that comes and goes.
When the water goes down, they know what to do.
They don't have another thing they can do.
You see a lot of oil on the ocean.
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.
You see people who are really shell-shocked.
They are very hardworking people.
These are the things that you can see.
There's a lot you can't see, also, underwater.
What's going on underwater?
Well, some people say there are oil plumes.
Some people say there are not oil plumes.
I think it's being hidden on purpose.
But you can see it.
We heard that bacteria eat oil?
Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish.
These guys have to swim around through it.
He has no bookings left.
That's the story of thousands of people.
Their numbers have never recovered.
It's going to take longer for some things.
These tuna swim the entire ocean.
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.
And they populate much larger areas.
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric.
The booms are absolutely not made for open water.
They get near shore. Look at these two boats.
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool.
The booms are only about 13 inches in diameter.
So it's just absolutely crazy.
Here are shrimp boats employed.
Here they are working.
All they're doing is stirring it.
It's just ridiculous.
And you'd have some idea of what to do.
That's certainly one of the things we need to do.
I think there are signs of hope.
We seem to be waking up a little bit.
So it's a continued fight.
It's a historic moment right now.
The first offshore wells were called whales.
The first offshore drills were called harpoons.
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time.
Now are we stuck with this?
Who says it's too expensive?
People who sell us fossil fuels.
Energy is always a moral issue.
It's an issue that is moral right now.
It's a matter of right and wrong.
Eli Pariser: Beware online "filter bubbles"
It meant a connection to the world.
Google's doing it too.
So here's my friend Scott's screen shot.
And here's my friend Daniel's screen shot.
Scott's results were full of them.
That's how different these results are becoming.
So it's not just Google and Facebook either.
This is something that's sweeping the Web.
So I do think this is a problem.
They enter the queue, they just zip right out.
So the best editing gives us a bit of both.
We need it to connect us all together.

Sebastian Seung: I am my connectome
Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
Your sequence and mine are slightly different.
That's why we look different.
I've got brown eyes; you might have blue or gray.
But it's not just skin-deep.
What do you guys think?
Are you more than your genes?
I think some people agree with me.
I think we should make a statement.
I think we should say it all together.
Everybody: I am more than my genes.
Sebastian Seung: What am I?
I am my connectome.
Right. All together now.
Everybody: I am my connectome.
SS: That sounded great.
I could just go home now.
This is the connectome of the worm C. elegans.
That's a lot of information.
What's in that information?
We don't know for sure, but there are theories.
But this is just a single neuron.
And still, you may not see the branches.
And we keep on doing that, slice after slice.
And we can do that for another neuron in green.
So you see how to find a synapse.
How can we find an entire connectome?
But seriously, what's wrong with this?
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.
And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
It will take the work of generations to succeed.
Likewise, every connectome changes over time.
What kinds of changes happen?
Second question: what causes these changes?
These signals are called neural activity.
The connectome is where nature meets nurture.
What's in this picture?
A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
What else is in this picture?
Neural activity is constantly changing.
Well, I propose a direct test.
They're going to be scrambled up.
I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.
Philosophers know this game very well.
Or will they someday chuckle over our graves?

Dan Barber's foie gras parable
The best culinary experience of my life.
Foie gras and the future of cooking.
I mean, it's crucified.
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
Its liver expands by eight times.
I mean, I love the stuff.
Not a lot of people are doing it.
And for good reason.
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.
What's natural about foie gras?
And it's shockingly not a new idea.
And they've been doing it quietly ever since.
It's like the Olympics of food products.
He placed first for his foie gras.
He said it sort of gleefully.
It was all over the papers.
I read about it. It was in Le Monde.
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."
They accused him of paying off the judges.
A huge scandal for a few weeks.
Couldn't find a shred of evidence.
Now, look at the guy.
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.
It's not foie gras because it's not gavage.
There's no force feeding.
I'm just here to give the geese what they want.
He kept going like this to me.
But he was still going like this.
I was speaking too loudly.
So I hushed my voice.
And he stopped doing this.
Right up to us, like right up to here.
Right along the fence line.
And fence line was amazing in itself.
He rewired it. He invented it.
I've never seen it. Have you?
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.
He electrifies only the outside.
He felt like they felt manipulated.
Now, what happened?
The landscape is incredible.
I mean, his farm is incredible.
It really is the Garden of Eden.
Extra hard land, right?
Extra difficult. Extra hard.
Upgrades the life for these geese.
And they are allowed to take whatever they want.
Part of the income for his farm.
A big part of his income for his farm.
But he never controls it.
That's how I've been trained.
It's the indication that it's the best foie gras.
The Lupin bush, it's all around Extremadura.
And the geese love the Lupin bush.
Not for the bush, but for the seeds.
Radioactive yellow.
"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.
"Shush, watch this."
And this squadron of geese come over.
And then they circle around.
[Clapping] And the wild geese are calling down.
And I'm just saying, "No way."
And he says, "No, no, no.
They've come to stay."
They've come to stay?
He said, "No, no, no.
They don't need anything more."
Think about that for a minute.
It's brilliant, right?
So how did it taste?
I finally got to taste it before I left.
I'm really in love with him at this point.
But it truly was the best foie gras of my life.
I'd had something that was called foie gras.
It was sweet, it was unctuous.
And I'm not like some super taster, you know?
But I can taste things.
There's 100 percent star anise in there.
No salt, no pepper, no oil, no spices.
He doesn't need salt and pepper.
How come you don't give him this?
How come no one's really heard of you?"
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.
I really was moved.
He said, "I think it's an insult to history."
And I wrote, insult to history.
It's like, why didn't I follow up on that?
What the hell does that mean?
The history of foie gras.
Jews invented foie gras.
They were looking for an alternative to schmaltz.
Gotten sick of the chicken fat.
They were looking for an alternative.
The Pharaoh got -- I swear to God.
He tasted it and fell in love with it.
He started demanding it.
And they invented, what? Gavage.
Supposedly, anyway. I believe that one.
That's the history of foie gras.
It's the history of what we eat today.
Most of what we eat today.
All of it, our food system.
That's also an insult to history.
It's rooted in extraction.
Take more, sell more, waste more.
And for the future it won't serve us.
Jonas Salk has a great quote.
We can start by looking to farmers like Eduardo.
That's serendipitous.

Later, I understood why my father got so upset.
I resolved to give back.
It was Bihar all over again.

J.J. Abrams' mystery box
And I took enormous comfort in that.
So thank you, if you're here.
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
He was the ultimate deconstructer, in many ways.
He would also supply me with tools.
And it was just, it was a magical place.
Which is good, but now I can't move.
Which is a savings.
But I've had this forever.
It represents hope. It represents potential.
There was no time to develop it.
Claire: Help! Please help me! Help me! Help me!
C: I'm having contractions!
J: How many months pregnant are you?
C: I'm only eight months.
J: And how far apart are they coming?
C: I don't know. I think it just happened.
It needs to be filled with something fantastic.
You know, I love Apple computers. I'm obsessed.
I guess I feel this -- I'm compelled.
It's literally the teaser. It's the big question.
Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box! You know?
You learn, oh, it's a message, you know.
But who the hell's Obi Wan Kenobi? Mystery box!
So to me, there's that.
And it's true in so many movies and stories.
It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.
He's showing up to L.A., tail between his legs.
And she's being eaten; there's a shark.
But it's an amazing scene.
Father: C'mere. Give us a kiss.
Father: 'Cause I need it.
ILM did the effects; it was incredible.
And sort of like my dream to be involved.

Patricia Kuhl: The linguistic genius of babies
I want you to take a look at this baby.
And she's talking to her baby.
And therein lies a critical puzzle.
Well, it's got to do with your brain.
After puberty, we fall off the map.
A six-monther adores the task.
What have we learned?
We're culture-bound listeners.
And the answer: before their first birthdays.
Two months later something incredible occurs.
So there are two things going on.
And those distributions grow.
English has a lot of Rs and Ls.
The distribution shows.
Six to eight months, they're totally equivalent.
Two months later, something incredible happens.
Here's what it looked like in the laboratory.
What did we do to their brains?
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
So this is little Emma.
She's a six-monther.
You can see, she can move around.
It's a technical tour de force.
What are we seeing?
We're seeing the baby brain.

Wael Ghonim: Inside the Egyptian revolution
This is Revolution 2.0.
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.
Because everyone was a hero.
Everyone has done something.
We all use Wikipedia.
Everything was going bad.
Everything was going wrong.
Those were the achievements of our great regime.
Yet, nothing was happening.
In fact, people were extremely frustrated.
Everyone was scared.
But in fact, the majority were scared.
Everyone did not want really to get in trouble.
A dictator cannot live without the force.
They want to make people live in fear.
It's helping all of us to connect.
There are a lot of people who are frustrated."
There are lots of people who are frustrated.
They probably have the best life in the world.
They are happy. They don't have problems.
It was an educational campaign.
Khaled Saeed was killed in June 2010.
I still remember the photo.
The photo was horrible.
He was tortured, brutally tortured to death.
But then what was the answer of the regime?
But people did not relate to this.
People did not believe this.
He was a middle-class guy.
His photo was remembered by all of us.
A page was created.
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."
Get those who killed this guy.
To just bring them to justice."
But of course, they don't listen.
Everyone was an owner in this page.
People started contributing ideas.
And next time it's going to be vibration."
People were making fun of the idea.
And they were doing this thing.
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.
They were actually attacking them.
There was no leader.
The leader was everyone on that page.
Yes we can. We can do it.
The revolution is happening.
I was detained on the 27th night.
But they detained me.
I was not allowed to speak with anyone.
The next day I was in Tahrir.
The fear is no longer fear.
It's actually strength -- it's power.
People were so empowered.
Completely opposite.
Extremism became tolerance.
I said that, "We are going to win.
We're going to win because we have dreams.
And that's actually what happened. We won.

Buddhism,compassion,culture,death,global issues
I want to address the issue of compassion.
Compassion has many faces.
They are not luxuries.
Without them, humanity cannot survive."
It is the big cats, and it's the plankton.
Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.
And early in the morning, I went into the ward.
I looked into her face.
I watched her hands as she bathed an old man.
Again, the eyes and hands of Avalokiteshvara.
They touched me at that time.
They have touched me throughout my 68 years.
She had phenomenal strength.
So we can ask: What is compassion comprised of?
And there are various facets.
Now I worked with dying people for over 40 years.
It is there within every human being.
The very word terror is global.
The very feeling of terror is global.
However, they return to baseline a lot sooner.
This is called resilience.
It hooks up all parts of the brain.
Hey, we live in a very noxious world.
Why don't we train our children in compassion?
And that is the mental quality of equanimity.
Jody Williams called it: It's good to meditate.
Step back, give your mother a break, okay.
He said, "I'm out of here."
He's going down the path.
He sees something in the path.
He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.

These are dilemmas I have every day.
So I remember getting my American passport.
I was like, "Woohoo! I'm going to travel."
"I'm trying to go places."
"Ah ha! American, great."
Then he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."
And he started asking me questions.
He said, "What is your father's name?"
He goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"
I said, "He passed away a long time ago.
His name was Jabbar."
You owe us two billion dollars."
Like I think you're missing the point here.
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.
"Why would I do that?
If I want the money, why would I kill myself?"
"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up."
"Well, then blow yourself up.
Just do it outside, please."
But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.
All it takes in one person to mess it up.
"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"
"We just wanted to say we tried."
"And furthermore, it is the thought that counts."
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."
Don't be Hassan. Don't be Hussein."
And the name came out Jack. I'm like, "Woooo!
That's not one of us."
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"
I just did a seven-country solo tour.
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.
And it's great, there's good people everywhere.
And you learn great things about these places.
For example, Dubai -- cool place.
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.
I was walking. I heard "Beep, beep."
I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."
It's like a drug deal.
"You want some frozen yogurt?
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Not in the Middle East.
I went down. I go, "Where's my son?"
"On the third floor, sir. On the third floor."
"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.
And they don't get paid that well.
I go, "He's got to be my driver."
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."
He goes, "I thought you were my driver."
"My name is Bond, Jamal Bond."

MT: Deception, it's a fundamental part of life.
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance.
Some people deceive for money.
Three cards, three chances.
Now where's the lady?
Where is the queen?
Well, I didn't deceive you.
You deceived yourself.
Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.
They believe they can win.
They forget the times they lose.
The brain is very good at forgetting.
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.
Bad experiences quickly disappear.
That's "Clair de Lune."
Thank you. Thank you very much.

That's because she dances.

"I'm laughing out loud."
"I want to give you a hug."

And I was one of those people.

She also embraced violence.
They were constantly short of cash.
They were constantly searching for cash.
I'll give you an idea.
Because they had no idea.
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
This guy thought in the same way I did.
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
And there are three main stages.
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
So what is rogue economics?
It has happened before in history.
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
It is trillions, it's not billions.
So, you see, what is the relationship?
This privilege is called seigniorage.
No other country can do that.
This is how close we are with this world.
And this is what people did.
It was introduced only in the United States.
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
So, why did I tell you this story?
And believe me, it's going to be scary.
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

Roz Savage: Why I'm rowing across the Pacific
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.

I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.

I eat fruits and nut bars, a lot of nuts.
Question number two: How do you sleep?
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.
That's a bad day at the office.
Do I have a chase boat?
And finally: Am I crazy?
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?
It pretty much covers half the planet.
The first attempt didn't go so well.
A bit like being in a washing machine.
Boat got a bit dinged up, so did I.
I tried to tell them to go away.
We had a bit of a battle of wills.
I lost and got airlifted.
Awful, really awful.
But what do you do?
Fall down nine times, get up 10.
But it was not without misadventure.
Fortunately, help was at hand.
They were going very slowly.
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.
This is big trouble for these guys.
I think there are probably three key points here.
And then that story changed.
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.
But what about if we just change that story?
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.
And when we do that, we're not just one person.
Anything that we do spreads ripples.
That's just one example.
This is a world-wide community.
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
It's meant to be a bit of a game.
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.

Stand up for yourself.
Geek. Fatty. Slut. Fag.
I always thought that was an unfair question.
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.
When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.
When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."
And they said, "Choose something realistic."
So I said, "Professional wrestler."
And they said, "Don't be stupid."
And I wasn't the only one.
See, my dreams got called names too.
Silly. Foolish. Impossible.
But I kept dreaming.
I was going to be The Garbage Man.
I was crushed, as if by a trash compactor.
I thought to myself, "What now? Where do I turn?"
This is how I stand up for myself.
I thought they were both pork chops.
Not really a big deal.
I saw no reason to lie.
As far as I was concerned, life was pretty good.
To this day, I hate pork chops.
But the school halls were a battleground.
We weren't the only kids who grew up this way.
To this day, kids are still being called names.
The classics were, "Hey stupid," "Hey spaz."
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.
You signed it, "They were wrong."

We only got out to walk and get gas.
Of course they did.

There's no delusion through the phone.
You look just like my mother." OK?
Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
And you all know what a phantom limb is.
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.
The patient's not delusional.
Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?
It sounds like an oxymoron.
And this is a serious clinical problem.
Patients become depressed.
Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?
So, how do you treat this syndrome?
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
Why does this happen?
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.
Now, how do you help these patients?
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
But that costs millions of dollars.
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
Now, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."
I said, "Move your normal hand."
And my pain is being relieved." OK?
And then I said, "Close your eyes."
He closes his eyes.
"And move your normal hand."
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."
"OK, open your eyes."
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"
So, he was like a kid in a candy store.
So he said OK, and he took it home.
He said, "It's gone."
I said, "What's gone?"
I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.
And I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"
He thought I was some kind of magician.
So, that's the bonus.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.
In us, all the senses are distinct.
These people muddle up their senses.
I'm going to answer that question.
It's never been answered before.
OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?
Well, there are many theories.
One theory is they're just crazy.
Now remember -- why does this happen?
Why would there be crossed wires in some people?
Remember I said it runs in families?
That gives you the clue.
Instantly, you've found the links.
The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?
Different shapes for different phonemes, right?
Here, you've got Martian alphabet.
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Buba.
Which one is Kiki and which one is Buba?
Well, it's one or two mutants.
Ninety-nine percent of you.
You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"
Martin Rees asks: Is this our final century?
And let me just run through a few slides.
So that's another project for NASA.
That looks like a coastline.
That's a challenge for 21st-century science.
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.
Well, let's go back to this picture.
Well, most of you anyway.
It may change this century.
It's new in our history.
But they will have a dark side.
We have to accept that there will be hazards.
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
What would they have seen?
The continental landmasses drifted around.
Ice cover waxed and waned.
This signaled the start of agriculture.
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
Then other things happened even more abruptly.
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
Or will the biosphere stabilize?
I work with a species called "Bonobo."
It's kind of a well-kept secret.
This species lives only in the Congo.
It permeates their entire life.
And it's used for communication.
And it's used for conflict resolution.
We divided our world up with lots of categories.
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
They had no stone tools.
To our knowledge they had no music.
He doesn't stand quite as upright.
But there are a lot of similarities.
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
And now we see all four.
SS: This is Kanzi and I, in the forest.
None of them are tricks.
We have eight Bonobos.
SS: An entire family at our research centre.
Video: You going to help get some sticks?
We need more sticks, too.
I have a lighter in my pocket if you need one.
That's a wasps' nest.
You can get it out.
I hope I have a lighter.
You can use the lighter to start the fire.
SS: So Kanzi is very interested in fire.
He's learning about how to keep a fire going.
This is a smile on the face of a Bonobo.
These are happy vocalizations.
Video: You're happy.
You're very happy about this part.
But he likes to carry things from place to place.
Video: Austin, I hear you saying "Austin."
This is his sister.
SS: She's got the pedals down, but not the wheel.
It means "star" in Swahili.
He can now cut through tough animal hide.
SS: Kanzi's learned to make stone tools.
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
She keeps staring out the window.
SS: I normally talk about language.
Video: Then Panbanisha does something unexpected.
It's a geometric language.
What is she writing?
SS: These are her symbols on her keyboard.
They speak when she touches them.
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
SS : Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
SS: That's an institutional requirement.
Panbanisha watched.
Soon she began to write as well.
How did they develop?
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
Is he looking for where the sound came from?
Researcher: Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Researcher: OK, now get the monsters. Get them.
Take the cherries too.
Now watch out, stay away from them now.
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
Now you have to stay away. Get away.
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
We're learning how to become like them.
And they're learning to become like us.
Michael Norton: How to buy happiness
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase.
I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.
We had a little natural experiment.
This article's about how their lives get ruined.
And it ruins their social relationships, in fact.
and fantasizing about what they'd do.
So the first way that we did this.
Also inside the envelope was money.
And we manipulated how much money we gave them.
What did they spend it on?
People gave money to homeless people.
Huge effect here of Starbucks.
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"
And then we asked them how happy they are again.
So for example, one guy from Uganda says this.
He said, "I called a girl I wished to love."
Here's a guy from Canada.
Very similar thing.
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.
Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.
But then we see extraordinary differences.
So look at these two.
This is a woman from Canada.
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.
Perfectly nice thing to do.
It's good to get gifts for people that you know.
Compare that to this woman from Uganda.
This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.
So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.
But enormously different motivations here.
These are only two countries.
Or are they negatively correlated?
And you can see, the world is crazily green.
So these are sales teams in Belgium.
But other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro.
Spend it on one of your teammates this week.
You don't get any money from that.
And we did the exact same thing as before.
And we luckily have an opportunity for you.
You and I can go on and buy it for them.
It's an extraordinary thing.
Internet,computers,statistics,visualizations,web
The cry of "Raw data now!"
So, let's roll the video.
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.
Yes, certainly you can do it over here.
How can you use this stuff?
So, that was government data.
Let's now spin the world during the same year.
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
Here focusing in on Haiti.
We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.
David Hoffman shares his Sputnik mania
The rocket was huge.
On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.
All hell broke loose.
It provoked the missile gap.
It exploded an arms race.
It began the space race.
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.
"Sputnik" will soon be released.
And I'd like to thank you all.

Joshua Walters: On being just crazy enough
My name is Joshua Walters.
They're just practicing.
One day they'll get here.
At least that's what it says on my pen."
Some of you are in the field, I can see.
I can feel your noise.
When I got out I had a choice.
And there's a book -- John Gartner.
Some of them committed suicide.
So it wasn't all the good side of the illness.
Your call. Your call.
And everyone's somewhere in the middle.
Everyone's somewhere in the middle.
Maybe no one's really crazy.
Everyone is just a little bit mad.
How much depends on how lucky you are.
Steven Strogatz on sync
Whoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.
Some trained musicians out there.
Is that what enabled you to synchronize?
These creatures are not choreographed.
They're choreographing themselves.
There are just three simple rules.
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.
And you see that in nature.
There are many eyes to spot danger.
Yes, it's happening here.
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.
How do the rules give rise to the patterns?
You can see it every night along the river banks.
On, more on and then off.
No one believed them.
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.
You can even be just a single cell.
They're keeping you alive.
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.
Hold your breath for me.
What I have here are two empty water bottles.
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.
I have some metronomes here.
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.
How can metronomes communicate?
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.
Let's see if we can get this to work.
I want a blade of light across the Thames."
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.
Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.
Boy: About the second one.
Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.
Woman: I remember wanting to get off.
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.
Think of the people as being like metronomes.
Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.
But how could the crowd become synchronized?
This was to be the focus of the investigation.
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.
Their instructions: just walk normally.
They're all having some difficulty walking.

Yossi Vardi fights local warming
We will talk today about local warming.
This message is given as a public service.
And be careful, your genes are in danger.
Will geeks become endangered species?
Global warming fun.
But let's keep things in proportion.
You are great. This is the correct posture.
Digital scrotum, digital media.
And this is what the young generation says.
4 am in the morning.
You cannot use this picture.
Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?
Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.
Burt Rutan sees the future of space
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
What they look at is the most important thing.
Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
That has not happened at all in space flying.
Well, who was inspired during that time period?
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.
These things tend to happen every 25 years.
There were only three or four flights in 2003.
This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
This is a picture here taken from orbit.
Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?
There's another one announced just last week.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
And the inventor is in this audience.
So fun is defendable.
There were a couple of examples here.
100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
OK, thank you very much.
http://www.ted.com/talks/william_li.html
cancer,food,medicine,science,technology
William Li: Can we eat to starve cancer?
So why should we care about blood vessels?
But cancers don't start out like this.
It invaded into his lungs.
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
In other words, can we eat to starve cancer?
So here's a test system we developed.
And extract from soybeans.
This means there's food synergy.
Here's some more data from our testing.
And that's what we're doing right now.
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.
Restart the treatment, loses the weight again.
Stop the treatment, it gains the weight back.
In other words, we can't create supermodel mice.
And there are many clinical trials.
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.

Scott Kim takes apart the art of puzzles
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
I've been doing that for about 10 years.
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
I thought this was a great assignment.
One hint: It's not "L."
It could be an "L," of course.
So, what else could it be?
Yeah, a lot of you got it.
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.
This was something really original. I got hooked.
You know, they might have a solution.
You can create one out of Legos.
You know, you can do anything you want.
I consider that puzzles are an art form.
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
This is called a figure-ground illusion.
Here we have "Day and Night."
Here is what I did with figure and ground.
So, here we have "figure" in black.
Here we have "figure" in white.
And it's all part of the same design.
The background to one is the other.
A few other things. Here is my name.
Each letter here is one of these digits.
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
It's the same this way.
This appears in my puzzle calendar.
Okay, let's go back to the slides.
Now, those are fun to look at.
Now how would you do it interactively?
For a while I was an interface designer.
And so I think a lot about interaction.
And here it is, figure-ground.
But that is also true of any white area.
I'll just go one step further.
Here is another thing you can do.
There is a game called Rush Hour.
It's made by the company Think Fun.
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
Okay, so how would you solve this one?
Well, move the blue one out of the way.
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.
You know? What do you do here?
The first move is going to be what?
I wanted to make a sequel.
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Now I'm making it available to schools.
I got interested in gene sequencing.
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.
But it takes some persistence.
Which way will these fall?
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
Gets you thinking about color.
So, we're making smart games for social media.
Well, guess what? That's changing.
And the main players are over 35, and are female.
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
And it's a game you play with other people.
And what does this add up to?
Here is what we see coming.
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
And we decided to combine our skills.
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.
And we have 24 seconds each.
I'll play as fast as I can.
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?
Okay, so that's the lens.
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?
That's the corner of the whole thing.
Scott Fraser: Why eyewitnesses get it wrong
And the car sped off.
That's the shooter I saw that killed the father."
Straightforward, fair trial, full investigation.
Oh yes, no gun was ever found.
And Mr. Carrillo's alibi?
So what's the problem?
It's called reconstructed memories.
I remember vividly where I was.
And you know something?
That's a totally false memory.
It could not be something you experienced.
Well, what's that got to do with this?
Take all the measurements and record them, right?
The teenagers said they could see very well.
Their eyes just glaze over, all right?
A shocker in American jurisprudence.
He pointed by, and this is what the judge saw.
This is the car 30 feet away from the judge.
That's 30 feet away.
Okay. There's 15 feet.
At this point, I became a little concerned.
I couldn't see the slightest bend of his head.
And that's what he saw.
And this is three to four feet away.
Why did I take the risk?
This is what he saw.
Which they decided not to.
He is now a freed man.
This is him embracing his grandmother-in-law.
We all have to be very careful.
All our memories are reconstructed memories.

Eve Ensler: Embrace your inner girl
Namaste. Good morning.
I'm very happy to be here in India.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it's in men as well as in women.
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.
To be a man means not to be a girl.
To be a woman means not to be a girl.
To be strong means not to be a girl.
To be a leader means not to be a girl.
For me, it was the turning point of my life.
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
My mind was so shattered.
And I will tell you a very funny story.
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
Girls are trained to please.
I want to change the verb.
I want us all to change the verb.
And she was holding her baby.
And I asked her if she loved her baby.
It's my baby and it's full of love."
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
She has literally become deputy mayor.
She's changed the rules.
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
And she knew that meant she would be cut.
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
And when she got to the house she was greeted.
We will not cut you.
For me, that is the power of girls.
And that is the power of transformation.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."
I'm an emotional creature!"
This is for her: I love being a girl.
I am an emotional creature.
I know when a storm is coming.
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
I love that I do not take things lightly.
These feelings make me better.
There is a particular way of knowing.
It's like the older women somehow forgot.
I rejoice that it's still in my body.
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.
And you know what? Sometimes it should.
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.
I am your remaining memory.
I can take you back.
Nothing's been diluted.
Nothing's leaked out.
Can you say it with me?
I love, I love, love, love being a girl!
Ron Eglash on African fractals
He was a very religious man.
He was a mathematician on a mission.
And so he came up with this beautiful curve.
It's the same pattern at many different scales.
And that worked for a hundred years.
Your body is covered with fractals.
So nature has this self-similar structure.
Nature uses self-organizing systems.
And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?"
This is a village in southern Zambia.
You have a huge ring.
So here's a little fractal model for it.
I came up with this structure here.
I think something's going on there."
So here's a Nankani village in Mali.
Once again, infinity is important.
And that was actually my original hypothesis.
But that turns out not to be true.
You can see on the pottery and the baskets.
And three times, the answer is no.
It's a shared technology in Africa.
And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?
It's not really mathematical knowledge.
It wasn't invented until the 1970s.
But sometimes, that's not the case.
You learn the next level of knowledge.
So this is very conscious knowledge.
Here's a wonderful fractal.
And his answer was very interesting.
Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.
And they wouldn't tell me.
They said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this."
And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.
So even plus odd gives you odd.
Odd plus even gives you odd.
Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.
Anybody in the world can use them.
We've started a pilot program in Ghana.
We've also been working in design.
It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.
It's in ecological sustainability.
It's also in some bad things.
These are robust algorithms.
So here's the good news about families.
Now, here's the bad news.
And here's the worst news of all.
Our children sense we're out of control.
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?
So how can we change this dynamic?
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.
They do things in small chunks.
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.
You succeed or fail quickly.
"That's what I thought," she said.
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"
And he made a checkmark.
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.
With kids, it's heaven."
What worked well this week?
Our kids love this process.
So they would come up with all these ideas.
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.
So what did we learn?
I'm proposing three planks.
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.
Parents can learn a lot from that.
Let's just take a few examples.
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?
We'll make Sunday meals more important."
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.
The conversation will go better."
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.
We've got to hook them up with parents.
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.
Plank number two: Empower your children.
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.
So we kind of liked that.
But then her sister started working the system.
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.
Now give us a punishment. Okay.
There's plenty of parental authority going on.
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"
To me that is a certified agile miracle.
And by the way, research backs this up too.
So the bottom line is, empower your children.
Plank number three: Tell your story.
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.
So how do you do that?
We had a pajama party.
My wife bought a flip chart.
What values do we most uphold?
And we ended up with 10 statements.
We are travelers, not tourists.
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.
Do you know where your grandparents were born?
So my final plank is, tell your story.
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."
Of course all happy families aren't alike."
The answer, I believe, is yes.
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.
It's a matter of choice.
What's the secret to a happy family? Try.
demo,invention,nanoscale,technology,water
Mark Shaw: One very dry demo
So what's superhydrophobic?
Did you guess the one that was dry?
And we're talking really small here.
So very small, but very useful.
And it's not just water that this works with.
You can see the difference.
It's that afraid of the water.
So what's going on here? What's happening?
So what are the applications?
We've certainly seen that today.
It could be anti-corrosion.
No water, no corrosion.
It could be anti-bacterial.
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

Morley sings "Women of Hope"
The Jill and Julia Show
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
So that's what I have to say.
science,storytelling,technology
So let the story begin.
Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born.
His name was Nikola, Nikola Tesla.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?
Nikola Tesla: The result is 118,236.
Probably a form of synesthesia.
NT: I needed no models, drawings or experiments.
Only then do I construct it.
MT: His great idea was alternating current.
To sell his idea, he became a showman.
It is the magic of science.
He even photographed the bones of the human body.
But Tesla's success didn't last.
NT: I had bigger ideas.
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
NT: They wouldn't give me the money.
NT: Yes, that was a big mistake.
He became a recluse.
His legacy is with us still.
Tesla's insight was profound.
MT: Tesla thought he had the answer.
We are still asking the question.
Robert Full on engineering and evolution
Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please?
So, organisms have this important history.
They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.
Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.
And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.
Now, why is this important to have this model?
And here's one example that's really exciting.
This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.
It just bends by itself beautifully.
It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.
Here's RHex entering the woods.
RF: Here's it going down a pathway.
You can't use regular cameras.
And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.
Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.
See it uncurl and then peel these toes.
And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.
It uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.
The animal does not use that.
But that's what we're limited to, at the moment.
Think of the contact of that that's possible.
When we measured the forces, they were enormous.
How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.
How about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?
If you put their foot under water, they grab on.
We also presented to Nike even.
So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.
business,education,leadership,technology,women
The numbers tell the story quite clearly.
190 heads of state -- nine are women.
A recent study in the U.S.
And he said, "No, we've been here about a year."
So the question is, how are we going to fix this?
How do we change these numbers at the top?
How do we make this different?
What are the messages we need to tell ourselves?
What are the messages we tell our daughters?
I don't have the right answer.
I don't even have it for myself.
This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.
One, sit at the table.
Two, make your partner a real partner.
And three, don't leave before you leave.
Number one: sit at the table.
And everyone kind of sat at the table.
Don't you love that kind of thing from college?
I wish I could do that now.
The three of us take this class together.
My brother is kind of busy.
"You got the top grade in the class?
You don't know anything."
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"
Why does this matter?
I wish the answer were easy.
Own your own success."
I wish I could tell that to my daughter.
But it's not that simple.
He changed exactly one word: "Heidi" to "Howard."
But that one word made a really big difference.
The bad news was that everyone liked Howard.
He's a great guy. You want to work for him.
You want to spend the day fishing with him.
But Heidi? Not so sure.
You're not sure you'd want to work for her.
This is the complication.
I said, okay, and she sat down, and we talked.
And she said, "I learned something today.
I learned that I need to keep my hand up."
I said, "What do you mean?"
We've got to get women to sit at the table.
The data shows this very clearly.
I think the cause is more complicated.
She starts leaning back.
And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married."
She didn't even have a boyfriend.
It needs to be rewarding.
You need to feel like you're making a difference.
Don't leave before you leave.
They're just not moving.
But I'm hopeful that future generations can.
I think it would be a better world.
I have two children.
Sirena Huang dazzles on violin
Hi everyone. I'm Sirena.
I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.
Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here.
So I did a little research on it.
Well, this is what I found.
Of course, I hope I can memorize it.
Design -- I love its design.
This is small and lightweight.
I can play from standing, sitting or walking.
The violin is very beautiful.
But besides, my brother found this very funny.
Now, I know why I'm here.
Like the multi-dimension stuff.
Thomas Goetz: It's time to redesign medical data
Because we are all patients, we are all people.
Even doctors are patients at some point.
It goes all the way back to Aristotle.
And doctors hate it, right?
I mean, they complain about it all the time.
People brush and floss their teeth.
They had a big patient population.
They divided them up into two groups.
So that was the low-fear group.
They showed bloody gums.
You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.
So go brush and floss your teeth.
That was the message. That was the experiment.
Now they measured one other variable.
So the upshot was this.
So fear showed up as not really the driver.
It was the sense of efficacy.
It's an amazing notion.
Except, maybe we do.
So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.
And I don't know if it works.
So let me just spool it out a little bit.
But it actually hits home.
And here's how they work in the feedback loop.
The choice in this case is pretty simple.
We either keep going fast, or we slow down.
They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.
Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.
It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.
But we have an opportunity.
This is a pharmaceutical ad.
But it looks completely right.
There is no good faith in this.
So this is a different approach.
So let me just walk through this quickly.
You can understand exactly what the benefits are.
So I love this. I love that drug facts box.
And so I came up with this: lab test results.
They're packed with information.
They go right to doctors.
This is the worst presented information.
So that's what I want to walk you through.
This is our one-page summary.
We use the notion of color.
It's an amazing notion that color could be used.
We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.
So that's our general blood work test.
Then we went to CRP test.
In this case, it's a sin of omission.
The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.
Here's the before, and here's the after.
We again personalized the risks.
And then again, the follow-up actions.
That's what Wired magazine spent on this.
Why is Wired magazine doing this?
It should be the patient.
This is information that is incredibly powerful.
It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.
But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.
But you can create your own feedback loop.
And the only acceptable answer is -- -- yes.
And then, what's next?
This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.
Michael Pollan gives a plant's-eye view
It's a simple idea about nature.
Let me tell you where I got it.
The bee is not calling the shots.
And I realized then, I wasn't either.
The competition of grasses, right?
And suddenly everything looked different.
And that's what the lawn was.
And I would submit that this idea does this.
Well, consciousness."
So who's the more sophisticated species?
Well, we're all equally sophisticated.
Now, the other use of this is practical.
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.
what else does he have?
So, one day, cattle in a pen.
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.
Very useful second ecosystem service.
So, it's a very productive system.
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"
What happens to the grass when you do this?
This is how soil is created.
It's created from the bottom up.
More for us, less for nature.
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.
There are a lot of farmers doing this today.
I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?
And he kind of nodded, you know?
And that always stuck with me all my life.
Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool.
As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all.
It would say you're wrong most of the time.
That was the computer we knew.
It's a room broken in two halves.
And the floppy disk drive person wears it.
And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.
Remember that excitement?
You see this little pattern here?
Well, content is the word up there: fear.
Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface.
Like, we gotta go to Fear.
It's, like, amazing, right?
It just changes the same content.
I can never get in there.
Free bold feels like Mandela free.
It's like, yes, I can be free.
So I made a lot of work in the '90s.
This was a square that responds to sound.
People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.
It's called "Tap, Type, Write."
It has 10 variations.
This is, like, a ring of letters.
It's peaceful, like that.
You know, when people say, "I don't get art.
And why do we have this facility?
And the shopkeeper would say, "It's old."
"Tell us more." "Oh, it's really old."
And he realized, it isn't about old or new.
It's about something in between.
We aren't functioning so easily anymore.
We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
And also "no love."
So that is authoritarianism.
And what is that, structurally?
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
How many coffees do you have?
How often are you calling them, emailing them?
Sergey Brin and Larry Page on Google
We spoke to you last several years ago.
The answer is boxers.
Now I hope all of you feel better.
But this is what helped me see it.
Here it's slightly logged.
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
There's a lot of activity in China.
There's a lot of activity in India.
So this is slowed down.
This is what one second looks like.
You can see that it got started right here.
as it did in Spain.
And I just wanted to play it for you.
Now does anybody know who this is?
SB: Yes! Somebody got it.
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
Okay, not very many people know about it.
I'll explain it in a second.
This is one of our engineers.
That's how we churn those products out.
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.
So this is what he built.
This is our VP of Engineering.
And these are all of his friends.
And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.
So it's a fun little project.
And -- well, I'll leave you in suspense.
Larry, you can explain this one.
Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.
So many, many useful things come out of this.
And this is how we keep our innovation running.
Don't really pay attention to them.
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.
How many of you use the Deskbar?
All right, see? You guys should try it out.
This is actually our "cult picture."
I just wanted to show quickly.
It makes it a really fun place to work.
You want it to be consistent.
Why don't we try changing it every day?"
And, you know, thank you.
I don't have to do my other job now."
It would be artificial intelligence.
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.
He was just kind of writing about his life.
Why don't they like my blog?"
And then we produced "You suck."
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
And that's unlike many of our competitors.
I am a proud Princeton dropout.
And it looks like this right now.
It looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?
It's not very good. It's cluttered.
They're not very well designed, right?
So, that's unfortunate.
Hopefully for good.
There's still a lot to explore.
I like it quite a lot.
They own half a billion people.
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.
But this next decade -- and that's a real thing.
The game layer is all about influence.
It's called the appointment dynamic.
And this is simply an appointment dynamic.
It also exists in more conventional game forms.
I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.
Farmville has more active users than Twitter.
That's a little scary.
But this could also be used for good.
That's an appointment.
It's something that people don't do very well.
You should get points for doing this on time.
Influence and status.
So this is one of the most famous game dynamics.
It's used all over the place.
It's used in your wallets, right now.
And this is used in games as well.
Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
That sucks. Why not level-up?
And it's very powerful.
It can be used in interesting ways.
This is used in conventional games as well.
And so people work very hard to level-up.
And here we have a game that people play.
And they made this into a game, initially.
So we have to use this one carefully.
But it can also be used to find real things.
Really powerful dynamic.
This next decade is the decade of games.
We can influence behavior.
It is very powerful. It is very exciting.

Tim Brown urges designers to think big
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.
Again, 18 months later, the product was obsolete.
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.
Important? Not so very.
But this wasn't always the way.
It's called the Great Western Railway.
Now, this was back in the 19th century.
One journey from London to New York.
So somehow, we went from this to this.
Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?
What makes technology useful and usable?
They make their own intraocular lenses.
And that connection is change.
So why design thinking?
What's the design brief?
So they developed and iterated these ideas.
So that's one thing that we've been working on.
Sheena Iyengar on the art of choosing
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
But I really like my tea sweet."
"One does not put sugar in green tea."
Resting on the saucer were two packets of sugar.
It is essential for success.
It's called "being true to yourself."
One girl named Mary said, "You asked my mother?"
You will surely find the perfect match.
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."
There are some dilemmas you see.
I am used to no choice."
We do not need everything that is there."
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France.
What do any parent do?
They had all suffered the same tragedy.
But there was a big difference.
We found that it did.
He gave us a new perspective on life."
How did they get me to do that?"
Rather, it teaches us when and how to act.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
And I can't decide.
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."
And the other one was called "Adorable."
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."
"What does it look like?"
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."
What's different about them?"
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.
And that's not really the case.
Now let's assume you go on holiday.
You might go to India, the Far East.
Well, you could develop flu-like symptoms.
They could be quite mild.
And that's the nickname given to this disease.
So why is it spreading so fast?
And the answer is this thing.
This is Aedes aegypti.
That's two days ago.
So we must be good at killing mosquitos.
I mean, that can't be very difficult.
Well, there's two principle ways.
The first way is that you use larvicides.
It's just not practical.
This is a picture of fogging.
You could do the same with a space spray.
We are going to use it in and around humans.
We don't want to do anything that you can't undo.
This one's not. It's invaded you.
But you don't want to get all of the insects.
You just want to get this one.
It's just the female.
So basically, we've used those two factors.
They only live a few days.
And that's exactly where we are.
And what's the result?
Well, the result has been very good.
We can transport them around the world.
So freight costs aren't our biggest problem.
There you are. We've sent mosquito eggs.
We've separated the males from the females.
We've also done this in agriculture.
And I'm in favor, actually. Of course I am.
So for the mosquito, it's a dead end.
health,health care,medicine,technology
Can geographic information make you healthy?
In 2001 I got hit by a train.
My train was a heart attack.
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
"Why now?" "Why here?"
"Could my doctor have warned me?"
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.
And you know why I understand that?
What does that mean, my environment?
Well, it can mean a lot of things.
This is my life. These are my life places.
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
It was insidious and it was really happening.
And I moved to Redlands California.
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
So, what's wrong with this picture?
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
They really don't do that. It's missing.
Look at the kind of data that's available.
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.
So, how many people are in the white?
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.
How many have spent it in the red places?
But none of that's in my medical record.
And it's not in yours either.
So, here's my friend Paul.
And this is where he has spent most of his time.
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
Did you know that data existed?
This might be what we end up with.
This could be my little assessment.
And they're in the early stages of development.
But it will also be useful for us.
Just look at that for a minute.
That was what he was talking about on that quote.
Rives controls the Internet
I just wish it were more organized."
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.
Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy.
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather.
I wouldn't need it.
Huh? Maybe Google would hire this.
I guess it's just like life.
We can interfere with the interface.
You don't say a prayer.
You don't write a psalm.
You don't chant an "om."
And this is a global business.
And this is a business incubator.
This is a shopping mall.
This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.
I don't conceive of it that way.
All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.
There's nothing underground about it.
It's our prejudgment that it's underground.
I think what we have is a pickle problem.
This is the pickle economy.
That's a huge number, and what does that mean?
It's a business plan for a corporation.
And it's not just in Africa.
We want our products in that store."
And then there's mobile phones.
We only sell you airtime.
And where's the airtime sold?
And where do the phones come from?
They're going to Eddy in Lagos.
The name is a misnomer.
Now, are there downsides to that?
Versace without the vowels.
Zhuomani instead of Armani.
You can buy cloned cologne.
You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.
Now, there's another problem.
This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.
All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?
Cooperative development is a way forward.
Paul Ewald asks, Can we domesticate germs?
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.
How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?
And you can test these ideas.
And the answer is -- yep, they are.
So this suggests we're on the right track.
But it doesn't tell you how long.
It's sort of cloudy water.
Now, I can think of some possible experiments.
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.
That makes me worry a little bit.
And this ethical problem's a big problem.
Here's a girl who's almost dead.
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.
And Peru's got something sort of in between.
They evolved to produce less toxin.
So, it's controlled.
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.
Well, in Peru it didn't.
It wouldn't be causing severe disease.
And the idea is very simple.
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.
So, you get this vicious cycle.
The goal is to turn this around.
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.
So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.
And the logic's a little more subtle here.
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.
And these are the data.
And so it's a short-term solution.
This is a long-term solution.
So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.
Todd Kuiken: A prosthetic arm that "feels"
This is our motivation.
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.
Our hands are amazing instruments.
There's also a huge emotional impact.
And finally, there's a profound social impact.
We talk with our hands.
We greet with our hands.
And when they're missing, it's a barrier.
There are two general types.
Here you see a patent for an arm in 1912.
They work by harnessing shoulder power.
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.
You open it, these muscles contract.
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.
We have robotic limbs.
There's no other functions.
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?
How do we control them?
And your sensation's the exact opposite.
Those nerves can put out command signals.
So we developed a different approach.
So this is the first man that we tried it on.
His name is Jesse Sullivan.
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.
And this is what it looks like.
His brain is thinking about his arm.
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.
There is not a learning process.
That's why it's intuitive.
He feels light touch down to one gram of force.
So it was very exciting.
This was one of our first patients, Chris.
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.
And you've got one of these conventional arms.
Can you tell us how it worked?
TK: So it was a little slow?
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.
You had to concentrate a whole lot.
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.
And how did that work for you?
I could work them just by my thoughts.
TK: A little faster?
TK: Okay, this was my goal.
It's like 96 percent.
And it provides intuitive control.
So that was all very exciting.
But we want to do better.
Can we get more out of it?
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.
And I also have the hand closed and open.
TK: Thank you, Amanda.
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.
I can wear it around.
Takes about a minute.
So Amanda, you can see, has really good control.
It's all the pattern recognition.
AK: I was able to get four.
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.
AK: Can't clap with this one.
I want you to watch closely.
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.
But look at all the electrodes around it.
I've got a real estate problem.
The future is bright.
We want to build a better arm.
So those are just some of our goals.
And fortunately, it worked today.
So thank you very much.

The first of these is informed consent.
our meeting did not end in my office.
Parag Khanna maps the future of countries
Do we live in a borderless world?
Before you answer that, have a look at this map.
Now, many of you will object.
For you this would be a more appropriate map.
You could call it TEDistan.
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?
Let's start with the world of 1945.
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
Over 50 new countries were born.
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.
Then came the end of the Cold War.
Today we have 200 countries in the world.
And as you know, China is the most populous.
And they share a lengthy land border.
Why do they call it that?
China isn't conquering Mongolia.
So let's apply this principle to Siberia.
But who is it going to feed?
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.
Again, globalization Chinese style.
Well it's China's turn again.
It starts with the global hubs.
Then there is trade.
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.
Now it encourages it.
If you add it all up what do you get?
All of this is happening without firing a shot.
What lines on the map should we focus on?
Let's start with Iraq.
The reason is Kurdistan.
But what are they guarding?
Is it really a border on the map?
No. It's the pipelines.
I don't believe we should.
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
It has no choice but to behave.
That is, of course, in Palestine.
This is the Hejaz Railway.
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"
Before it was, how do we control their oil?
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.
A great deal of them.
Just take Azerbaijan.
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.
And that is, of course, Europe.
In fact most of that happened on just one day.
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.
I mentioned Azerbaijan before.
Of course, we can't forget Africa.
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.
Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?
Actually Greenland.
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.
What is the lesson from all of this?
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
Now we fear changes on the map.

Dee Boersma: Pay attention to penguins
I want to talk about penguins today.
Now there are over 30,000.
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.
You have to train to be able to do that.
So penguins are amazing athletes.
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
And that's what I came to study.
These are the rarest penguins in the world.
And this is true of most of our living systems.
This is a cold-water event called La Nina.
things die when there's no food.
They're not breeding; they're not even around.
I studied marine iguanas at that point.
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
There were plenty of them.
So they were just minding their own business.
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.
Why are there even these penguins oiled?
I'm just going to talk about two things.
The same thing's true for penguins as well.
This is Turbo the Penguin.
Turbo's never been fed.
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.
What is this guy doing?
This is really pretty weird."
And you'll see soon that my graduate student ...
And now look at this: not friendly.
This is a radio frequency ID system.
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.
See, this one's coming back to its nest.
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.
So, thank you very much.
Dave Meslin: The antidote to apathy
How often do we hear that people just don't care?
And I'll give you some examples of what I mean.
Let's start with city hall.
You ever see one of these before?
This is a newspaper ad.
As you can see, it's impossible to read.
Now that would never happen.
So you're never going to see them on a billboard.
This is the cover story.
Then you get to their political articles.
Heroes: How do we view leadership?
They all have heroes who were chosen.
There's a prophesy. You have to save the world."
It's an ongoing process your whole life.
But most importantly, it's voluntary.
Political parties: oh boy.
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism.
It's like trying to run into a brick wall.
But we can change all those things I mentioned.
We can open up city hall.
We can reform our electoral systems.
We can democratize our public spaces.
This is a dream of the ages.
And we didn't study any of these animals.
It's quite a cute little fellow.
So this animal is going to live twice as long.
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.
But everything else is just lying there.
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.
She says, "I'm 60."
That's what it's like. And you would never know.
You would never know, until she told you.
So what is the daf-2 gene?
And the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor.
So part of it is like a baseball glove.
That's what that arrow means.
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.
So this is altogether really, really interesting.
So what kind of hormones are these?
You know about a lot of them.
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.
And it's looking like that's the case.
And that is the case in flies.
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.
So maybe it's working in people the same way.
And there are hints of this.
It damaged the gene.
How could that work?
The receptor isn't working as well.
And it's just sitting on one of them.
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.
And the immune system is more active.
So it's really interesting.
So what about the normal worm?
So it can't turn the genes on.
But what good is this for the worm?
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.
And that's why we think the animals live longer.
But it's deteriorating.
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.
And they all come and they fortify the house.
So this is really exciting to me.
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.
Matt Ridley: Thank you, Cynthia.
Let me get this straight.
You could change the genes in principle.
There isn't the technology to do that.
But I don't think that's a good idea.
Just move to one side for us, if you would.
And they grow to be about this size.
And our long-lived mutants are too.
CK: Yes, that's right.
It's more like, say, if you were a dog.
They're not getting old in the dog's lifespan.
It's more like that.
MR: Thank you very much indeed, Cynthia Kenyon.

Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.
Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.
I can see I've got my work cut out for me here.
So how do we ask this question?
What can we do? It's not so easy.
Persistence means long-lasting.
Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.
Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.
Now, how far does this analogy go?
Remarkably, the answer is yes.
They flunk out of CalTech.

Gero Miesenboeck reengineers a brain
I have a doppelganger.
That's exactly what I do -- optical mind control.
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?
But think for a moment what that means.
There's 10,000 neurons here.
We don't understand the code used by the brain.
To make progress, we need to break the code.
We need to rearrange the pattern.
The more targeted our interventions, the better.
But we'll certainly learn a lot.
But these pores here are special.
She cut the heads off of her flies.
They just stand around and groom excessively.
They didn't get very far, obviously.
Here's some such CCTV footage.
And the logic of our experiment was simple.
Its behavior is completely unchanged.
This is one piece of good news.
culture,humor,love,relationships,sex
and not to have sex with anyone else, ever.
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.
They go shopping for all sorts of things.
And the big day comes.
Of course, the other half won't, right?
And researchers want to know why.
So what's going on when it doesn't?
What are they doing right?
What can we learn from them?
For example, the happy wife.
Because we needed a study to tell us this.
But here's what's going on here.
Here's an interesting one.
This is an actual study, and let me clarify.
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.
They actually call it the Oscar curse.
But here's a scary one: Divorce is contagious.
Now I have to say, I don't get this one at all.
We're healthier, physically and emotionally.
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.
So we have to keep an eye on that.
And we do like a cocktail or two.
So I've got all those things going for me.
I'll see you at the bar.
Robert Full: Learning from the gecko's tail
These are gecko toes.
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
And here is its first test.
More recently, this happened.
Man: How do you know?
Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance.
Here is the actual robot.
And here is what it does.
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."
Even though we put a passive bar there.
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.
We know that you can grab onto things with them.
It can also act as a counterbalance.
So watch this kangaroo.
See that tail? That's incredible!
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.
And it was unstable without its tail.
But of course, this is a passive tail.
And you can also have active tails.
It can also be used in defense.
So we then went back and looked at the animal.
And we ran it up a surface.
So here is normal speed.
This is incredible.
The engineers had a really good idea.
They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.
And we did that experiment, that you see here.
And this is what we discovered.
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.
But there it is slowed down.
But geckos do it better.
And they do it with their tail.
If we could have the lights on it.
Okay, there it goes.
And show the video.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
So we did. And here is what it does.
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.
So we can maneuver this way.
It can actually swim through the air.
Stay tuned for that.
And it certainly looks like it.
You can see it even better from down on top.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"
Look at the end to see the animal.
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
Jehane Noujaim wishes for a global day of film
And I know what you're thinking.
She's not. She's at the TED Prize.
Wow! Some of you watched it.
That's great. That's great.
This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.
This is Donna eating ice cream.
So we're not forcing people to travel.
And I began to start teaching there.
So I was 18; I was very excited.
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.
And I just saw the power of the image.
And it was incredible.
And so that's what really kind of started me off.
So I knew that I had to go there.
I just wanted to be in the center.
I had no plan. I had no funding.
I didn't even have a camera at the time.
I've got to go see what this is all about.
Sameer Khader: Business as usual.
Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
I still have that dream.
Maybe I will never be able to do it.
But I have plans for my children.
I will pay for their study.
And they will stay there.
And it was revolting.
It was absolutely revolting.
It made me sick to my stomach.
And it didn't affect me as much.
It makes me hate war.
We had no funding for it.
Al Jazeera offered him a job.
And I saw this with audiences.
Woman: That's no sacrifice, that's revenge!
Man: Then let us be equal in death.
We still have Paradise.
May God forgive you.

Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?
Man: How, if Israel has no morals?
Ayelet: What do you know about the casualties?
We're looking for three girls.

Brian Greene on string theory
And let me show you what it is that he found.
And that communicates the force of gravity.
Even the Earth warps space around it.
Now look at the Moon.
We go to a full-frame view of this.
It really works. It describes the data.
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?
Amazing -- it just popped out.
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.
We don't seem to see them.
Let me show you that one visually.
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.
And I hope you appreciate this.
It took so long to get these ants to do this.
Let me show you what that would look like.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
So, let me just tell you how that goes.
Superstring theory -- what is it?
The idea is like this.
That is where conventional ideas stop.
Here is the new idea of string theory.
They don't produce different musical notes.
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.
Now here is the catch.
Now, does string theory offer an answer?
This is a deep question.
So can we explain those 20 numbers?
Let me show you how.
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.
So let me bring some strings into the story.
How would we know it?
Let me show you that idea visually.
But here's how the experiment will go.
You take these particles. You slam them together.
Amazing possibility.

mission blue,oceans,science,technology
We'll look at sea level rise.
We'll look at ocean warming.
What frightens you?"
for me, it's ocean acidification.
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.
So I will spend a little time at the end.
It really wasn't on the radar screen.
It's not clear what the target should be.
Should it be 450? Should it be 400?
Now, why is this so complicated?
There's air-sea interactions.
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.
That changes our climate.
I'll show you a few examples of this now.
It's a scientific drilling vessel.
And so that's what we've done with this ship.
It looks downright tropical there.
Most of the time it looked like this.
We had a waves up to 50 ft.
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.
It's the ANDRILL project.
And we drilled in the Ross Sea.
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.
Here's the cartoon on the left there.
And here's what we found.
That's the kind of material in the deep sea.
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.
And this is in the past four million years.
This was completely unexpected.
And it could be larger than that.
This is from Champion Island.
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.
We saw no other mass mortality events.
Here's how we sample the corals.
This coral is eight meters tall, right.
And it been growing for about 600 years.
So we have a diamond drill.
So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.
Each one of those is a year.
And we just count on down to the bottom.
Their ratio tells us the water temperature.
Here's a synthetic diagram.
There's a whole family of curves here.
We do similar things with ice cores.
We work with tree rings.
This is as messy as it gets.
You can see there's some signals there.
Some of them show greater variability.
It was cooling down until about 1900 or so.
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.
So, you cannot argue with that.
It has many consequences.
There's consequences for carbonate organisms.
That material is more soluble in acidic fluid.
Beau Lotto: Optical illusions show how we see
I want to start with a game.
So, we have two panels here, of colored dots.
And you have to tell me which one.
How many people think it's the green one?
And how many people think it's the orange one?
Let's find out what the reality is.
Here is the orange one.
Here is the green one.
And here is the gray one.
So, this is pretty amazing, actually, isn't it?
And instead of telling you, I'll just show you.
Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?
And now you see it.
And these are two projections from the world.
They are identical in every single way.
Identical in shape, size, spectral content.
So how on Earth do we even see?
There is no inherent meaning in information.
Audience: "Can you read this?"
"You are not reading this."
"What are you reading?"
But you put one there. Why?
So you don't do it again.
So, if I could have the lights down up here.
One is simply the flipping of the other. Okay?
But I really want you to learn.
That's what it's learning. Okay?
So why don't you do that now?
Can I have the lights up again?
That's your new normal.
So, what does this mean for context?
And the same thing over on the right.
And see what happens to your perception.
So you see it that way.
This is one I made a few years ago.
The four blue tiles on the left are gray.
They are the same. Okay?
Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.
Now I want you to keep looking at it.
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?
Are we the only ones that see illusions?
The answer to this question is no.
So in my lab, we of course work on bumblebees.
And we do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.
And you'll see one of the bees come out here.
You see how she has a little number on her?
Now, they are not born that way. Right?
And here she comes down the ladder.
It looks like they're going to green flowers.
Now, are they getting it wrong?
But those are blue flowers under green light.
Okay, this is complete rubbish.
And they can navigate the world using their ears.
On the left is what his camera sees.
That line is broken up into 32 squares.
In each square we calculate the average color.
He finds it. Amazing. Right?
And then we translated these images.
And this is one of those images.
And this is what it sounds like.
So, a six-year-old child. Okay?
Now, what does all this mean?
So, if we have the lights down.
I'm going to do this opposite on the left here.
Okay. So they are physically the same.
Let's pull the covers off.
Do they look the same? No.
The question is, "Is that an illusion?"
And I'll leave you with that.

Bruce Schneier: The security mirage
And they're different.
You could feel secure even if you're not.
And you can be secure even if you don't feel it.
And language is actually a problem here.
The question is, was it worth it?
Now there's often no right or wrong here.
In politics also, there are different opinions.
We often won't even notice them.
They're just part of being alive; we all do it.
Every species does it.
I'll give you the short answer.
Now most of the time, that works.
2010 New York, not so much.
Now there are several biases in risk perception.
A lot of good experiments in this.
So I'll give you four.
This is for children.
So you can imagine how that works.
This works until you invent newspapers.
We're also a species of storytellers.
We respond to stories more than data.
And there's some basic innumeracy going on.
We're really good at small numbers.
There's a false sense of security.
Maybe it's what the CIA's supposed to do for us.
So back to economics.
And there are two ways to do this.
So what makes people notice?
Enough real world examples helps.
Okay, so what makes people not notice?
Well, a poor understanding.
Not enough examples.
There aren't enough examples of failures.
So let me complicate things.
I have feeling and reality.
It doesn't change; it's real.
So feeling is based on our intuition.
Model is based on reason.
That's basically the difference.
You don't need a model.
There's no feeling about germs.
You need a model to understand them.
It's limited by our cognitive biases.
But it has the ability to override our feelings.
I was born in New York City.
Models can come from industry.
A lot of models come from science.
Health models are a great example.
Think of cancer, of bird flu, swine flu, SARS.
So models can change.
Models are not static.
For us, we're very facile around electricity.
It hasn't changed as we were growing up.
And we're good at it.
Models eventually fade into the background.
Intuitive is just another word for familiar.
So there was that feeling of lack of control.
There was no new data, but there was less fear.
This kind of thing happens a lot.
I'm going to give one more complication.
We have feeling, model, reality.
I have a very relativistic view of security.
I think it depends on the observer.
And I call that their agenda.
This is not uncommon.
Think about seat belts.
When I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt.
All examples of models changing.
What we learn is that changing models is hard.
Models are hard to dislodge.
Global warming is a great example.
We're terrible at models that span 80 years.
We can do to the next harvest.
We can often do until our kids grow up.
But 80 years, we're just not good at.
So it's a very hard model to accept.
Strong feelings can create a model.
And we rely on others. We rely on proxies.
I flew here yesterday.
I didn't check the airplane.
It's a model we just accept pretty much by faith.
It's manipulation, but it can work.
Change happens slowly.
Some of this stuff is hard.
Someone else bought it and died.
This terrified people.
There were a couple of copycat attacks.
Those tamper-proof caps, that came from this.
It's complete security theater.
I'll give you one, a syringe.
But it made people feel better.
I visit her in the hospital.
I said, "Well, that's kind of neat.
It basically never happens.
It's not just reality; it's feeling and reality.
What's important is that they be about the same.
All human life, all life, depends on plants.
Just think for a moment.
All these things, they come back to plants.
And without them we wouldn't be here.
Now plants are under threat.
They're under threat because of changing climate.
But it goes down below ground many stories.
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.
This is a nuclear-proof facility.
God forbid that it should have to withstand that.
And those are the dry land species.
They search for them. They find them in flower.
And they go back when their seeds have arrived.
And they collect the seeds. All over the world.
The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical.
And this is a distributed network.
And that is very useful information.
And that's already happening.
So where have we got to?
This is at least 100 times bigger.
These seeds are used for restoration.
How much does it cost?
2,800 dollars per species is the average.
I think that's cheap, at the price.
And we're almost there.
children,culture,humor,psychology
And it was found close to here, Stanford.
As soon as the door closed...
two out of three ate the marshmallow.
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
Couldn't do it. Could not wait.
What did they find?
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.
They were happy. They had their plans.
They were doing fine.
They did not make it to university.
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.
A few were still there with bad grades.
A few had good grades.
And let me show you what happened.
So what happened in Colombia?
But she will be successful.
And this applies for everything. Even in sales.
That person ate the marshmallow.
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.
Then you sell a lot more.
So this has applications in all walks of life.
I end with -- the Koreans did this.
activism,arts,cities,culture
Robert Hammond: Building a park in the sky
So they elevated it.
And by 1980, the last train rode.
And then it was abandoned.
At the time, there was a lot of opposition.
Mayor Giuliani wanted to tear it down.
This was after 9/11; the city was in tough times.
And it turns out, we got those numbers wrong.
So far it's cost about 150 million.
It turns out we were wrong on that.
There's three sections.
We opened the fist section in 2009.
It's been successful beyond our dreams.
It's this amphitheater right over 10th Ave.
And the first section ends at 20th St. right now.
And this has been designed by Renzo Piano.
And they're going to break ground in May.
This was just installed last month.
Jonas Gahr Støre: In defense of dialogue
And I can tell you, our agenda is full.
We loosely call them "groups."
And we struggle with how to deal with them.
So in a way, it is everybody's business.
They need political solutions.
It was black or white.
And who would talk to terrorists?
You cannot talk to everybody all the time.
And there are times you should walk.
And sometimes military intervention is necessary.
Let us turn to Afghanistan.
The situation, to be honest, is very serious.
We just have to persevere."
Everybody seems to agree with that.
Now everybody agrees.
Because we didn't talk.
We didn't grasp what was going on.
And you can always walk.
It's hard, but it is necessary.
Let me go one step further.
This is Tahrir Square.
There's a revolution going on.
It will last for a long, long time.
And who knows what it will be called in the end.
That's not the point.
Social groups are taking to the streets.
Should we talk to Hamas?
If we talk to them, we may legitimize them."
I think that is wrong.
Because they may turn out to be a majority.
How will we ever be interlocutors?
But talking can be done in different ways.
It's their right to fight."
Now as you know, Mandela didn't do that.
So what can we learn from all of this?
We have to connect with these profound changes.
And what is dialogue really about?
Sometimes you have to.
But that strategy seldom takes you very far.
We are seeing some new signs.
And they brought their knowledge.
This is perhaps a first element of a change.
The good thing is that we are not powerless.
Thank you for your attention.
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."
And, you know, "Excuse me!"
Wha -- what do you do?"
So, some people are afraid of what I do.
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.
I don't know, you know?
The place is 64 square miles.
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.
He's got a great chapter about it.
Where did they get that inspiration?
There's many mysteries, these statues.
So, this used to be completely smooth.
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.
This is the conventional nuclear fuel cycle.
Now, this is the normal way it's done.
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.
Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.
And I'm trying to use a very scientific approach.
This is a high-speed centrifuge.
You would not believe it!
Theory is red, black is experiment.
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.
And I resemble that remark.
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.
You know, skiers pray for snow?
Paleontologists pray for erosion.
You hike around, you see something like this.
It's about the size of a banana.
It has a big serration on the edge.
Study of the ancient climate is very important.
Now, I'm also really big on photography.
And I get lots of pictures like this.
They don't have them.
That's kind of what it's like.
That's it, thank you.
New York,art,book,cities,humor
Ben Katchor's comics of bygone New York
I'm going to read a few strips.
But at dusk everything changes.
It has a deep melancholy ring.
Children don't like it.
It's why they leave lights on around the house.
Adults find it comforting.
Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?
Or the distant peel of thunder?
That's the end of that.
The most perfect examples occupy corner lots.
And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap."
You were late for school again this morning.
The illusion of speech follows incidentally.
What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?
The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.
Pears dried in the form of genital organs.
Apricot halves like the ears of cherubim.
That's the end. Thank you.

David Logan on tribal leadership
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.
We'll go back a little more than a year.
It was February 3rd, 2008.
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
All of you are members of tribes.
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
So here is the bottom line.
And so people form tribes.
They always have. They always will.
But here's the rub.
Now here is the net out of this.
You're all a member of tribes.
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.
You don't want this. Okay?
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.
Stage One produces people who do horrible things.
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
It's not enough to simply write people off.
But let's move on to Stage Two.
It will be despairing hostility.
Actually, no, I'm not.
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
You find them in all places in society.
What kind of innovation would get done?
In fact it would be basically nil.
And we park. And we stay.
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
I'm great and you're not.
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four.
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.
This is their lobby.
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
Notice people are applauding for us.
But you'll notice the level of excitement.
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
There is, in fact, another stage.
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.
We're great! Who is not great? England!"
What about Martin Luther King?
Two percent are at Stage One.
And our values are beginning to unite us."
And those are the ones that change the world.
I'd like to show you some examples of this.
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.
I don't know anybody.
In fact, that's progress.
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.
That's called a triadic relationship.
And ultimately that adds to their values.
You know they do polls, right?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
So, they were bored.
Incidentally, they did pull it off.
And they released the first-ever world poll.
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
You remember to talk all five culture stages.
Because we've got people in all five, around us.
So let me start with genomics.
It is the hot topic.
It is the place where we're learning the most.
This is the great frontier.
But it has its limitations.
It's like the parts list of your body.
I can make them healthy."
And there probably are special cases of that.
So why all the big deal about genetics?
It is very useful in certain circumstances.
It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on.
So this happens in physics all the time.
But it rarely happens in biology.
And it matters how much of the protein it is.
People have tried very hard to do this.
I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.
Not going to be easy."
He's like, "No, no. I really need it.
We have to have a window into this."
So we started playing around with this.
They really tell us what's going on there.
So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red.
We overlay them. This is actual data.
So let me move to cancer.
So this is the great paradigm.
We know that that works.
It's you; you're broken.
So how do we diagnose that conversation?
I think this is the big mistake.
I think cancer should not be a noun.
That's kind of the level at which it is.
Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.
We put it in the equivalent of splints.
Krista Tippett: Reconnecting with compassion
We're here to celebrate compassion.
And the going is pretty rough right now.
Compassion is a worthy successor.
So what is it, three-dimensionally?
What are its kindred and component parts?
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?
Compassion is also curious.
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.
Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.
And compassion does seek physicality.
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.
Compassion also looks like this.
This is Jean Vanier.
And compassion can also have those qualities.
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.
Well, he was complicated.
Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.
So was Mother Teresa.

Susan Cain: The power of introverts
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."
And I felt kind of guilty about this.
Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.
It's different from being shy.
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.
But now here's where the bias comes in.
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.
I'll give you some examples.
So no wilderness, no revelations.
And do you really want to leave it up to chance?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.
So that's the world we're living in today.
That's our cultural inheritance.
I have a suitcase full of books.
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.
But these are not exactly my books.
But here's the thing about my grandfather.
And that actually helped a lot.
School, same thing.
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.
Rick Warren on a life of purpose
And I said, that I got to write it.
I really think that's there's this inner desire.
I don't think there are accidental kids.
And I think you matter.
Why do I feel like a fake?
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.
I'm going, OK, you know. Fine.
And that was: what is the purpose of this?
Because it brought in enormous amounts of money.
I started it with one other family in 1980.
Everybody's betting their life on something.
I just don't believe that.
That's kind of a no-brainer.
So, what is it for?
It's not going to be mine after I die.
I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.
Not any more than any other species."
And you are responsible -- that's my worldview.
This is why I believe what I believe."
But you may, you may.
It determines, really, everything in your life.
I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.
I don't own a guesthouse.
We just said, we're not going to use it on us.
It makes a difference what you believe.
It's all about more, having more.
But that's not the good life.
And that I know, personally, I know, is not true.
It's just not true.
Giving your life away.
It doesn't come from sex.
It doesn't come from salary.
It comes from serving.
That's the way we were wired, I believe, by God.
That, actually, was the easy part.
Because I start getting all kinds of invitations.
And being a pastor, I started reading the Bible.
That's what he prays.
He says, "I want you to make me famous.
I want you to give me power.
I want you to make me famous.
I want you to give me influence."
They're not on my radar.
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.
They're just not in my pathway.
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
And God says, "Moses, what's in your hand?"
What's in your hand?
Moses says, "It's a staff.
It's a shepherd's staff."
And God says, "Throw it down."
And then God says, "Pick it up."
Number one, God never does a miracle to show off.
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"
But He doesn't do miracles just to show off.
So, He's going, "What's in your hand?"
Now, what was in Moses' hand?
First, it represented his identity.
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.
What do you do with a shepherd's staff?
You pull them or you poke them, one or the other.
What's in your hand?"
And I asked them, I said, "What's in your hand?
You're an NBA player. It represents your income.
And it represents your influence.
And that gives with you enormous influence.
What do you have that you've been given?
What are you doing with what you've been given?
That, to me, is the primary question about life.
These things shape you.
If you're wired to make deals, you make deals.
If you're wired to paint, you paint.
Did you know that God smiles when you be you?
It's about making the world a better place."
Negroponte takes OLPC to Colombia
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.
And suddenly, the kids have connected laptops.
They've leapfrogged.
Before, they were closed off.
Now what are some of the results?
They own the laptops. They take them home.
Her mother had not gone to primary school.
So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops?
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.
You don't vaccinate a few children.
You vaccinate all the children in an area.
Kathryn Schulz: On being wrong
My friend looks at me totally blankly.
And what I'm talking about is this.
We get it in the abstract.
I think this is a problem.
And second, why it's such a problem.
Dreadful. Thumbs down.
Embarrassing. Okay, wonderful, great.
But just being wrong doesn't feel like anything.
I'll give you an analogy.
That's when he falls.
I call this error blindness.
Think back for a moment to elementary school.
This is not mine, by the way.
We learn these really bad lessons really well.
Right, Mr. CFO, astrophysicist, ultra-marathoner?
So let me tell you a story.
Beth Israel's in Boston.
Everything seems to have gone fine.
So this is a huge practical problem.
But it's also a huge social problem.
So this is a catastrophe.
It's that you can see the world as it isn't.
And yeah, it is also why we get things wrong.
It's totally fundamental to who we are.
And my first thought was, "I've lost it.
I've become the crazy wrongness lady.
And something else happened instead.
I mean, this is life.
Didn't really work out that way, did it?
Where's my jet pack, Chris?
So here we are again.
And that's how it goes.
We come up with another idea.
We tell another story.
We hold another conference.
Juan Enriquez wants to grow energy
What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
So where's the link between these two things?
Chip Conley: Measuring what makes life worthwhile
Because what we actually count truly counts.
Let me start by telling you a little story.
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
Well, not exactly, of course not.
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
But the king was serious.
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
Wow, that's interesting.
How many know him? Anybody?
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?
Good question. But back to Bhutan.
Co-branding opportunities.
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
So how do we do that?
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
But all of those questions are tangible.
They're about demographics.
We're not asking meaningful metrics.
We're not asking important questions.
We're not asking anything that's intangible.
We've been fooled by our tool.
Excuse that expression.
GDP has been our hammer.
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.
They aren't the same.
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
We count on people.
What can you start counting today?
Beau Lotto: So, this game is very simple.
All you have to do is read what you see. Right?
BL: All right. One, two, three.
Audience: What are you reading?
I said, read what you're seeing. Right?
It literally says, "Wat ar ou rea in?" Right?
But we're talking about perception here, right?
They begin with a question.
Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty.
So if you add rules to play, you have a game.
That's actually what an experiment is.
The first step was to ask a question.
So we did it anyway. Right? Of course.
So Amy, would you please come up?
Student: There's two up there.
And now we want to share. That's the next step.
So we go, of course, to the pub. All right?
The one on the left is mine, okay?
And the discussion is, who cares? Right?
That's a science paper, basically.
All the ones in bold are eight to 10 years old.
The work would be publishable if done by adults."
So what did we do? We send it back to the editor.
What was the feedback like?
And I'll just read one.
So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor.
Can I do it on you?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. Yeah yeah. Okay.
And you like technology, right?
Shimon Schocken: Right, but I like myself.
Everyone over there shout.
Where's the sound coming from?
Thank you. BL: Thank you very much.
Van Jones: The economic injustice of plastic
People thought about, "Oh, my God.
This is terrible, this oil -- it's in the water.
It's going to destroy the living systems there.
People are going to be hurt.
Poor people also suffer at the point of use.
You often have to buy the cheapest products.
Often, we think we're doing a good thing.
No, I'm going to be virtuous.
I'm going to put it in the blue bin."
You put yours in the white bin."
And we use that as a moral tickle.
We feel so good about ourselves.
Maybe I'll feel good myself.
Not you, but I feel this way.
We're so happy to see you, little bottle."
"You've served so well."
And say, "What would you like to do next?"
The little bottle says, "I just don't know."
But that's not actually what happens.
That bottle winds up getting burned.
It's just awful, those poor people.
I hope someone does something to help them."
We're back where we were in the 1970s.
We don't have disposable resources.
We don't have disposable species.
And we don't have disposable people either.
It turns out we're a pretty clever species.
A clamshell's hard.
There's no vacuums. There's no big furnaces.
There's no poison. There's no pollution.
We would have a different economy.
That should be the goal.
We're so proud to live here in California.
I don't know what those other states were doing."
And, yeah, I'm proud, too.
We have a moral challenge in this moment.
Most of you are good, softhearted people.
Eric Giler demos wireless electricity
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"
I mean, think about how much we love this.
The other thing is, we love batteries.
So I thought I'd better look it up first.
Wires suck, they really do.
The other thing is, batteries suck too.
And they really, really do.
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?
40 billion of these things built.
This is what happens.
And nature really does abhor a vacuum.
So how does it work?
Number one question I get asked.
You know. What about safety?
It doesn't radiate.
We live in a magnetic field.
Mobile electronics.
There are industrial applications.
And then finally, electric vehicles.
These electric cars are beautiful.
But who is going to want to plug them in?
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.
We put one on the back of the television set.
So, I'll plug that in.
It creates a magnetic field here.
It causes one to be created out here.
How many people want to hang them on the wall?
Imagine if you can get rid of it.
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.
So, I wanted to show you something.
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.
It runs the Android operating system.
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.
It's odd. It has a battery.
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados.
But they typically use it to light up the screen.
And think of what that would do for you.

To me, this says three things.
First, don't become a cannibal.
So what happens to all these toxins when we die?
I think there's a better solution.
We want to eat, not be eaten by, our food.
And now about these ninja pajamas.

Stephen Lawler tours Microsoft Virtual Earth
What does this all mean for us?
But we want to use our brain!
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
Here is an example of our aerial camera.
In addition, it's multi-spectral.
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.
Extract geometry from the images.
This process is a very calculated process.
In fact, it was always done manual.
We think about the user interface.
What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.
I thank you very much for your time.
Jonathan Trent: Energy from floating algae pods
So here's what I came up with.
Why are we talking about microalgae?
Now, why do we want to do this offshore?
Some cities just release the water.
At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
It leaks. It's struck by lightning.
So let me show you how the system works.
And what about operating costs?
And what about capital costs?
Where else could we potentially put this system?
There's lots of possibilities.
You're publishing it.
CA: All right. Thank you so much.

culture,economics,global issues,politics
My topic is economic growth in China and India.
Look at the skyline of Shanghai.
This is the Pudong area.
You're being constrained by the public's opinion.
Here's the key question.
This is a key issue.
And Country 2 is possibly India."
That's not too good.
The picture there is Khrushchev.
Country 2, that has fewer telephones, is China.
And Country 2 is China.
Let me look at this question more directly.
Is democracy bad for economic growth?
Both countries are in Asia.
And which one is a democracy?"
Those two countries are geographically similar.
One reason is the East Asian Model.
Korea succeeded, North Korea didn't.
Taiwan succeeded, China under Mao Zedong didn't.
Burma didn't succeed.
The Philippines didn't succeed.
So exactly why did China grow so much faster?
China was during the Cultural Revolution.
So that's when China was mad.
The whole country went mad.
And this is the earliest data that I can find.
This is an extremely strange fact.
So India is reverting to the normal.
In China, it's all women.
What about the political system?
They have increased the security of proprietors.
There are also financial reforms in rural China.
Indira Gandhi declared emergency rule in 1975.
This is a very impressive record indeed.
Which country has the growth momentum?
But I believe that India has the momentum.
It has the improving fundamentals.

Steven Johnson: Where good ideas come from
This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.
You would be sharper and more alert.
And I think I've found a few.
So, the technology is there.
And this is what they ended up coming with.
It's called a "neonurture device."
In the inside, it's all car parts.
That's really where innovation happens.
I mean, this is one vision of it.
This is a statue from Oxford.
And "oh, eureka," they've got the idea.
Darwin is a great example of this.
That's in his autobiography.
It will be useful in 2020.
Could you just give me some time to do that?"
But that's a key thing.
And of course, this is nerd heaven, right?
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."
That's an interesting idea."
So they made it really easy to find it.
We should record it."
That's pretty cool."
Could you go the other way?
So they went back, and they thought about it.
And he said, "Oh, that's great.
Could you work on that problem?"
And that's how GPS was born.
That is how innovation happens.
Chance favors the connected mind.
Eva Vertes looks to the future of medicine
My story starts way before I was born.
I was a passive observer of the medical world.
So this really, really fascinated me.
Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
So, there's so much interplay here.
Rick Smolan tells the story of a girl
I used to be a photographer for many years.
I had never heard the word Amerasian before.
I was 28 years old.
And of course, I was immediately intrigued.
I had a sleeping bag.
And then, my translator left.
Her mother was still alive.
They slept on the floor at night.
Hyun-Sook was 11 years old.
I decided to follow her to school.
This is the first morning I stayed with her.
This is on the way to school.
This is the morning assembly outside her school.
And I noticed that she was clowning around.
This is on the way home.
And that's North Korea up along the hill.
This is up along the DMZ.
And I said, "OK, what did I do? What's going on?
Why is everyone crying?"
And she refused any help at all.
And I gave the grandmother my business card.
But I was off on assignment.
Did I know anything about this?
And the house that I had spent time in was empty.
It was incredibly cold.
And I said to the translator, "What did he say?"
And she said, "He wants to know who you are."
I was very worried about her.
And I said, "I'm staying in a hotel downtown.
Would you like to come and have lunch tomorrow?
And we went outside, and he was just furious.
And I knew I had totally blown this whole thing.
This was now, I think, February, early February.
And the pictures before were taken in September.
So, this is on the way down to the orphanage.
This is Father Keene. He's just a wonderful guy.
This is a social worker interviewing Hyun-Sook.
He actually agreed to the adoption.
I kind of said, "Oh God, now what?"
So, my friend Gene flew over with his son, Tim.
Gail couldn't come.
This is the uncle signing the adoption papers.
This is the third night we were in Korea.
And I said, "Yeah, I have one too."
I'd been doing this every night I'd been there.
And we can't talk to her.
And the other is unbelievable guilt.
Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?"
I said, "Yeah, somewhere in my Halliburton."
He says, "We've got to stop the smoke."
I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.
Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.
People were lying on the floor.
It was one of just the most horrifying nights.
It's so weird how life just goes on.
This guy's 60 years old.
So, these are the greenhouse tents.
This is the elders teaching Gene their dances.
Like, what could you do for a year?
Her great aunt at the airport.
It was like the ultimate perk.
She never liked it very much.
She learned English in three months.
She entered seventh grade at her own age level.
Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.
This is her cooking teacher.
She's being baptized.
And Gail and Gene did the complete opposite.
She hates this picture -- it was her first job.
The captain of the cheerleaders.
Used to do their Christmas card every year.
This is her half-sister.
This is Natasha's wedding day.
Gene is looking a little older.
Natasha's actually never heard me tell the story.
Natasha: Later, I'll do that later.
Thank you all of you.
astronomy,biology,life,technology,universe
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.
That match was unambiguous.
But there was no evidence.
"What is life? What is the origin of life?
Now, the good news.
It's a new telescope.
So, what have we learned?
We do that in our solar system.
And that's what the frustration was.
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.
But you see, we haven't gone very far.
We were still back where Copernicus was.
And we didn't have the evidence for that.
And now for the first time, we can say that.
There is a lot more work we need to do with this.
Most of these are candidates.
In the next few years we will confirm them.
But the statistical result is loud and clear.
So the question is: what do we do next?
It's about 100 million such planets.
That's great news. Why?
We know and expect that we'll see that.
That's great, but that is not the whole news.
That's not why I'm here.
And so, that's what we are trying to do.
And that's what many people now are trying to do.
So why should you care about that?
Why am I trying to sell you a half-built bridge?
Am I that charming?
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.
This pixel is the Earth.
It is the Earth as we know it.
But it's really tiny.
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.
Life on Earth is the size of the Earth.
Let's actually try that.
So in space, the Earth is very small.
Can you imagine how small it is?
It will be the size of a single, small atom.
It is unimaginably small.
We can't imagine it.
But that's not the whole story, you see.
The universe and life are both in space and time.
This is not insignificant.
This is very significant.
So what does this tell us?
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.
And, up there, you see Uganda.
Now, what has happened?
But first, I have a new invention here.
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.
So, ready, steady, go!
They went upwards like this.
And almost the same happens here.
Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.
So there's some problem with these metrics now.
But focus now is back on prevention.
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.
We have to stop that.
So, why is it so high? Is it war?
No, it's not. Look here.
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.
And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.
Look here at Kenya.
I've split Kenya in its provinces.
So, what is it then?
But where are they situated?
I will swap the bubbles to a map.
HIV exists all over the world.
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.
Brazil has many HIV-infected.
India has many because they are many.
Southeast Asia, and so on.
It could be concurrency.
It could be some virus types.
And what is concurrency?
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.
We have serial monogamy.
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?
And you collect a big number of exes.
Probably, it's a combination of this.
You can get this chart, free.

Niall Ferguson: The 6 killer apps of prosperity
Let's talk about billions.
Let's talk about past and future billions.
And we know that most of them are dead.
And this chart goes back to 1500.
They start off pretty close together.
It's based on purchasing power parity.
This wasn't just an economic story.
Everybody did empire.
This is not a new question.
That's a great question.
It's not geography.
It's the institutions.
This must be true because a Scotsman said it.
That is so right and so cool.
And he said it such a long time ago.
Let's call them the killer apps.
They're just icons; you click on them.
But behind the icon, there's complex code.
It's the same with institutions.
Two, the scientific revolution.
Three, property rights.
Four, modern medicine.
Five, the consumer society.
And six, the work ethic.
Think of what that means.
That really was a killer application.
You just have to feed me."
Hardly anyone in South America did.
That's another killer app.
It even did that in the European empires.
The empires weren't all bad.
You need people to want to wear tons of clothes.
Finally, the work ethic.
Max Weber thought that was peculiarly Protestant.
In fact, the West has lost its work ethic.
Who's got the work ethic now?
and Albania and Tunisia.
Because the killer apps can be downloaded.
And could Africa get that sequencing wrong?
Warning: that may not work.
But I don't think his studio has been rebuilt.
That's not the way history works.
The West may collapse very suddenly.
What's your view on that?
He was an expert in Latin American history.
That tells you something really important.
Mostly they're worried about each other.
I think that's its real importance.
BG: Niall, thank you.
Cheryl Hayashi: The magnificence of spider silk
Spiders are truly global citizens.
Spiders are also extremely old.
There are many kinds of spider silk.
We spend long days ...
Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.
And this is what we see.
These can be grouped into seven categories.
Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.
But what, exactly, is spider silk?
Spider silk is almost entirely protein.
We call that the tool kit of a spider.
Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.
Think of hunting with silly string.
That's how scytodes forages.
That's just the best.
Clay Shirky on institutions vs. collaboration
How do groups get anything done? Right?
You found something. It can be private or public.
But you get these resources together.
So, that's what I want to talk about today.
Some people get less dressed up.
Young and old, dancing in the streets.
I didn't take them. How did I get them?
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.
Delicious is a social bookmarking service.
Now, what hard problem is being solved here?
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.
Right? You have to have economic structure.
You have to have legal structure.
You have to have physical structure.
And that creates additional costs.
You can't hire everyone in a company, right?
You have to exclude some people.
You lose the institutional imperative.
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there."
"Call me when you get off work." Right?
These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."
It's taken over a wider geographic area.
What matters is this.
This is called a power-law distribution.
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.
You can follow this in the Guardian.
It's actually quite entertaining.
Right? How do you capture that?
Right? Bad hire. Right?
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?
What if it was a security patch?
Do you want that patch, right?
The inventors don't know what the invention is.
Stay-at-home moms. Right?
So they're reinventing it, using these tools.
I think this is a revolution.
And I use that word advisedly.
It has de-professionalized publishing.
How will they share ideas and opinions?
Here's another example.
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.
We're used to support groups being beneficial.
It takes us from Point A to chaos.
It's going to be much more complicated than that.

Alison Gopnik: What do babies think?
What is going on in this baby's mind?
Let me give you just one example of this.
Now the question is: How could we ask them?
So how do we actually ask them the question?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli.
I tasted the broccoli. Mmmmm."
I tasted the crackers. Eww, yuck."
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies.
On one side is a New Caledonian crow.
They're as smart as chimpanzees in some respects.
All right, why would we see this correlation?
They go out and test it against the evidence.
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis.
This is Reverend Bayes's notebook.
They're just learning how to count.
Here's one from Cristine Legare's lab.
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors.
Boy: How about this?
Same as the other side.
Boy: This one lighted up, and this one nothing.
AG: Okay, he's got his experimental notebook out.
Boy: What's making this light up.
AG: Okay, hypothesis two.
AG: Now this is his next idea.
Not working either.
AG: Okay, that's a fourth hypothesis.
Boy: It's lighting up.
So when you put four.
AG: Okay,there's his fifth hypothesis.
Well, what's it like to be this kind of creature?
And I think just the opposite is true.
So what's it like to be a baby?
Now it's good to be a grownup.
It's good to be a grownup.
Raghava KK: Shake up your story
I'm an artist and a dad -- second time around.
It's a children's book for the iPad.
It's a little quirky and silly.
You can tickle the rug.
You can make the baby poop.
You can do all those fun things.
You can burst bubbles.
You can draw, as everyone should.
It's not the way I was brought up.
Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.
Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple.
I have to tell you about my childhood.
Basically, I celebrated every religious function.
We all had to fast during Ramadan.
It was a very beautiful time.
This caused major riots in my city.
I'm like, "Dude, I'm Hindu."
Imagine history being taught differently.
I have another idea.
You have to separate fact from bias, right.
But they're playing geopolitics.
You know, I'm making a very important argument.
business,future,health,science,technology
And what I found was quite surprising.
That's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.
We organized into cities. We had many people.
We saw genome sequences.
So it's not in our nature to pre-act.
You know, public policy and moral progress.
And it was quite an experience to be there.
And everyone then started writing about this.
Thousands of people started writing about this.
If you put electricity on them, they emit light.
It's a strange place inside a nanotube.
Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.
New ways of making electric transportation.
We need better surveillance.
Vaccines that are broad spectrum.
Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly.
Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.
So what we need to do is, we need better policy.
Markets are a very strong force.
How could you keep the law?
Well, you have to hold people accountable.
The law requires accountability.
But that's the price of having a civilization.
Benjamin Wallace on the price of happiness
I'm just going to play a brief video clip.
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.
So, I decided to embark on a quest.
This was the first one.
And it arrived, and it was tiny.
And I was outraged.
It was like, 160 dollars for this?
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.
I almost couldn't finish it.
I was really happy when I was done.
10 seconds passed and it was gone.
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.
They did give me a tour, though.
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
It has 360-degree views.
It has four balconies.
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.
That said, a lot of work goes into these.
But no compliments.
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
It was very green, it was very peppery.
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.
Oh, yeah, you know this one?
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.
Japan is doing crazy things with toilets.
There's one with a fragrance dispenser.
The seat is preheated.
There's a water jet that cleans you.
There's an air jet that dries you.
You get up, it flushes by itself.
The lid closes, it self-cleans.
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.
And I want to get one of these.
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.
And you spend a third of your life in bed.
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.
This was a fun one.
And it was really amazing.
It was such a smooth ride.
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.
But it's 60 years old.
There's not much of it left.
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.
It was three days, four meals.
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
And I wasn't that impressed.
And it wasn't just to that wine.
http://www.ted.com/talks/penelope_boston.html
Penelope Boston says there might be life on Mars
Notably Mars, as a first example.
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.
And so, life is more valuable than no life.
So, wonderful things and grim things.
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?
And so this is very exciting news.
So, what about life on Mars?
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.
So this is a very bold statement.
How do you plan to look for it?
How do you know it when you find it?
So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.
So why might it be hard to find?
We say small, but what does that mean?
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.
Well, this is what we apply to our work.
It's bursting with life.
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.
This is very unusual for caves.
This stuff is produced biologically.
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
Why would we want to do it robotically?
These are hopping microbot swarms.
And these allow them to hop.
Did life start here and was it transported there?
Did it start there and get transported here?
personal growth,self,storytelling,success
Derek Sivers: Keep your goals to yourself
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
So, let's look at the proof.
So, if this is true, what can we do?
Exactly, well done.
evolution,medicine,paleontology,science
Probably not, but people like me do.
But this is only one half of the story.
But there are a lot of challenges for this.
And first of all, what do we even study?
Many of you may know it by the term tartar.
And we even find it in neanderthals and animals.
food,global issues,health,social change
I'm Ellen, and I'm totally obsessed with food.
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.
I think about eating a lot, and I really love it.
"What are you doing for America's kids?"
The numbers are pretty crazy.
Well, they're both about food.
And agriculture is where food comes from.
Well, agriculture in America's very interesting.
Who is farming them? That's what I was wondering.
And their farms are also large.
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.
Hello. You don't put soda in bottles.
I think that's the only way to look at it.
You know, there's 30-year cycles.
And it'll be growing over the next few months.
culture,education,entertainment,gaming,technology
Tom Chatfield: 7 ways games reward the brain
I love video games.
I'm also slightly in awe of them.
And yet, many of these get built.
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.
It gives you great powers.
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.
It's something called the reward schedule.
I've got to keep opening boxes.
Let's think about probability.
It keeps people engaged.
That would be very boring.
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.
But we don't just have pies in the boxes.
There's 100 percent up here.
But we don't just do that either.
So all this is very powerful.
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.
So we can do some rather amazing things.
They're not rational about probability.
They think this game is unfair.
Our games don't always do this.
So what does all this mean in practice?
Third, you reward effort.
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.
And fifth, the element of uncertainty.
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.
We just want to go back and find out more.
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.
And two things really flow from this.
This can all seem very sinister.
The word "addiction" is thrown around.
There are real concerns there.
This is what really excites us.
They tracked these on a separate website.
And the success rate is at close to 100 percent.
Let's start with business.
We can use calculated randomness.
architecture,arts,creativity,design,theater
We are for decorative purposes only.
Now, who do we have to blame?
And we architects are cowards.
Now, something else happened.
The second position is: Actually take positions.
Take joint positions with your client.
But it has to be done together.
You do not know what the end result is.
This is the modus operandi that we have today.
Well, that's exciting.
The second issue is a nuance of the first.
All they needed was labor.
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.
We created what we like to call superfly.
And here is the fruition of that in actuality.
I'll go through the three basic configurations.
This is the flat floor configuration.
The first configuration is easy to understand.
I'll do it again so you can see it.
And there it is in the thrust configuration.
Effectively you would have something like this.
The proscenium can fly.
That's an enormous benefit.
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.
Here it is in an end stage configuration.
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.
It was very unusual.
Here it is in a thrust configuration.
I'm going to show you a brief time lapse.
Again, just a couple people are required.
So, just in conclusion, a few shots.
There it is at night.
Golan Levin on software art
We've got about a minute left.
This will take about 30 seconds or so.
He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.
Thanks very much. There's always lots more.
How do you do that?
Let me just give you two examples.
So, you see two examples here.
What is our approach?
What you see here is a prototypic device.
It's about a centimeter on the side.
It's about the size of a fingernail.
The lines around the edges are a polymer.
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.
That's what a hydrophilic surface does.
Now, how simple can you make the production?
Why do we choose paper?
So, the production capability is there.
It just -- you don't want to do that.
And here you simply burn it.
And the answer is, of course, yes.
It's something called a lateral flow immunoassay.
The wax printer does what looks like printing.
The printers cost 800 bucks now.
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.
That takes about two seconds to make.
And so I regard that as done.
It's what's called "fever of undiagnosed origin."
Do they have T.B.? Do they have AIDS?
Do they have a common cold?
Now even that's more complicated than you think.
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."
"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."
And the colors indicate "disease" or "normal."
They're everywhere, six billion a month in India.
And we'll start by posing a little problem.
And, of course the answer is, "You don't."
You make it flow under and over.
It works really, really well.
Interesting problem.
So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.
Rory Stewart: Time to end the war in Afghanistan
Why are we spending $135 billion?
Why have we got 130,000 troops on the ground?
How has this happened?
So the question is: What are we doing?
Why are we still stuck in Afghanistan?
All of this is wrong.
Every one of those statements is wrong.
Because this isn't the 1990s anymore.
There was amazing improvements.
And we had progress in the free media.
And the same is true for the troops.
Today, he could never do that.
Now is this a new idea?
And yet, nobody listened to them.
Well guess what? It didn't.
How do we allow any of this to happen?
You feel deep, deep guilt.
What is the solution to this?
Diplomats are locked in embassy compounds.
And there was not a single Pashto speaker.
So we need to change that institutional culture.
And thirdly, we need to have some humility.
A million properties have been returned.
The national army has shrunk.
But you need to look at context.
Why mountain rescue?
This is the wrong way of looking at it.
It's about context.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And we are always being tempted up to our neck.
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck.
We could have done that.
BG: Rory, thank you very much.
cities,politics,race,statistics,urban planning
Nate Silver: Does race affect votes?
I want to talk about the election.
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
He won 375 electoral votes.
One exception is in Massachusetts.
That was John Kerry's home state.
He lost badly but every Democrat does.
He lost no worse than most people do.
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.
They asked this question.
Here is the same data on a map.
So we have to ask why.
Is racism predictable in some way?
Is there something driving this?
Or are there more systematic factors at work?
So yes, racism is predictable.
There is a big difference.
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.
It's about who you live with.
I'm a big fan of cities.
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.
Abraham Verghese: A doctor's touch
Her blood pressure was an alarming 230 over 170.
Unfortunately, it happens all the time.
I am not a Luddite.
I teach at Stanford.
We're losing a ritual.
This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
The woman says, "Good Morning."
She says, "It was good."
She says, "I left him with my sister at Leith."
And she says, "I am."
And Bell then goes on to explain to the students.
And so she must have taken the ferry over.
You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.
Later he renamed it the stethoscope.
He made no attempt at diagnosis.
I call it the iPatient.
The focus was around the patient.
This is when I was in Texas.
And she was reluctant to tell me.
She said, "The cancer center was wonderful.
They had her scanned inside out.
But to her, it mattered deeply.
I was very influenced by that anecdote.
I say that because these are difficult patients.
There was just no way.
And if I tried, I'd disappoint them.
And I began my ritual.
I'm not sure why you're laughing.
That was the original intent, was it not?
We signal transitions of power with rituals.
We signal the passage of a life with rituals.
Rituals are terribly important.
They're all about transformation.
I would pull down the eyelids.
I would look at the tongue.
I would feel the abdomen.
It was an offering, an invitation.
I percussed. I palpated. I listened to the chest.
I will see you through this.
I will never abandon you.
I will be with you through the end."
Michael Shermer on strange beliefs
I'll show you an example of a bad idea.
I brought this with me.
This was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
So it looks something like this.
It'll go this way for sure.
Sir, you want to empty your pockets. Please, sir?
People remember the hits; they forget the misses.
In this case, we tested it.
"Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.
Are people getting smarter or dumber?
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.
Sort of an interesting thing.
Are science and religion compatible?
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible?
These -- they're just two different things.
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.
It's a way of thinking about things.
Or that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?
There's nothing more to it than that.
You can say a miracle occurs.
It's just that it doesn't explain anything.
So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?
Camera's ready -- that's it.
And it wasn't solved until 1655.
It wasn't till -- Huygens had two things.
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
And then I'll go to more serious ones.
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.
If you squint, you can still see the face.
And so, you're reducing the quality of your data.
Faces are important for us socially.
And, of course, happy faces.
Faces of all kinds are easy to see.
You can see the happy face on Mars, there.
Do you see him there?
Little froggy legs.
Or if geologists were elephants?
Religious iconography.
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.
Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
I actually went to see this one.
And we went down, investigated.
Anybody can do it, turns out.
Boy, couldn't you just listen to that all day?
You can't miss it when I tell you what's there.
And in England, there's a pop singer.
And she wrote a beautiful song.
And she has this one passage here.
At least she got it close.
And said, "I'm so embarrassed.
And she re-cut the song.
So I'll end with the new version.
Dean Ornish on the world's killer diet
Seth Godin on the tribes we lead
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.
Unfortunately I couldn't go.
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.
They make balloon animals.
But what do we do for a living?
We try to make big, permanent, important change.
But we don't think about it that way.
And I've been studying it for a couple years.
First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.
And everyone said it was impossible.
And he went to Reno and he did it again.
It is a moment in time.
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
Because he's got an efficient enough factory.
You can change the fabric of an entire country.
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
Take a good idea and push it on the world.
I have a better mousetrap.
And you can build an entire industry on that.
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.
And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.
I call it the idea of tribes.
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.
You've got the organized armies over here.
You've got the disorganized rebels over here.
You've got people in white hats making food.
And people in white hats sailing boats.
But they always stop and take a picture.
You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.
He did it by creating a movement.
You don't need everyone.
They're about the same age. But that's about it.
You know, this is one of my favorite devices.
But let me just try a couple.
The Beatles did not invent teenagers.
They merely decided to lead them.
Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me."
I see what the status quo is; I don't like it."
We need to organize around it."
So Tony Shea does not run a shoe store.
Zappos isn't a shoe store.
It's exactly the same behavior though.
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."
By leading a movement and making change.
And around and around and around it goes.
So three questions I'd offer you.
The first one is, who exactly are you upsetting?
The second question is, who are you connecting?
And the third one is, who are you leading?
So Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.
It's a story of a product that tells a story.
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.
They challenge what's currently there.
The second thing is, they build a culture.
They connect people to one another.
Do you know what people want more than anything?
They want to be missed.
They want to be missed when they're gone.
And tribe leaders can do that.
Being a leader gives you charisma.
Finally, they commit.
They commit to the people who are there.
So I'd like you to do something for me.
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Jane Chen: A warm embrace that saves lives
Please close your eyes, and open your hands.
Now open your eyes.
What you see here is a premature baby.
Four million of these babies die annually.
That is the primary function of an incubator.
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.
So, this is what we came up with.
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.
This is a phase-change material.
culture,entertainment,global issues,media,music
Shereen El Feki: Pop culture in the Arab world
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.
And should they ever come in contact ...
I want to show you two examples.
The first is 4Shbab.
: Video clips from across the globe.
And they look something like this.
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.
And it's called "The 99."
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.
It's now a theme park.
There is an animated series in the works.
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
architecture,arts,future,history,music
David Byrne: How architecture helped music evolve
It was, remarkably, a pretty good sounding room.
This is a song that was recorded there.
This is not Talking Heads, in the picture anyway.
The sound system was kind of decent.
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
And it's been very exciting.
Do I have a place, a venue, in mind when I write?
Is that a kind of model for creativity?
The music works perfectly in that setting.
It's perfect for that particular context.
It actually improves it.
This is a little bit later.
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
It fits the room perfectly.
And well, that was an opera experience.
And the size of the room is not that big.
It's smaller than this.
But Wagner made an innovation.
He wanted a bigger band.
This is Carnegie Hall.
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
And they're a lot more reverberant than La Scala.
They had to be very quiet.
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
That was Bob's last record, yeah.
Popular music, coming along at the same time.
This is a jazz band.
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
And they'd say, "Play that part again."
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.
And a new form of music was born.
These are played mainly in small rooms.
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
And this was one way that the music got there.
Other singers after him went even further.
This is Chet Baker.
And he's singing right into your ear.
He's whispering into your ears.
The effect is just electric.
So at this point, music diverged.
There's live music, and there's recorded music.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
And another new form of music was born.
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.
So there's more new venues.
One of the new ones is the automobile.
I grew up with a radio in a car.
But now that's evolved into something else.
The car is a whole venue.
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.
So that doesn't really work.
And does it happen anywhere else?
So birds do it too.
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.
We already know where that passion is going.
And they'll vote for that.
Christianity,God,death,faith,religion,technology
Billy Graham on technology and faith
And I was so stimulated.
I was to address a conference at a hotel.
And the man said, "No, who?"
He said, "It's Billy Graham, the preacher."
He said, "You don't say!"
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."
And there's one that I want to talk about.
He was a man of tremendous leadership.
He had the favor of God with him.
There were many problems still left.
The first one that David saw was human evil.
Where does it come from?
How do we solve it?
And yet he says, "He restores my soul."
But on the other hand, something is wrong.
Now, what causes this?
But he made this statement.
The problem is not technology.
The problem is the person or persons using it.
What's life all about? Why am I here?
What shall I talk to her about?"
And he surprised me with the answer.
That's what she's really interested in."
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.
I'm not reading. I never read an address.
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."
We see people on our screens.
They don't know that she's dead.
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
The old stars, they come to life.
But death is inevitable.
About 300 of them were there.
I said, "We're all going to die.
I've talked to them.
It passes so fast."
But it does not need to have to be that way.
On the contrary, they're sisters."
He put it on a personal basis.
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.
And I said, "Sir, I do."
He said, "So do I."
Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.
I didn't make good grades in high school.
One day, I was faced face-to-face with Christ.
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.
I'm the embodiment of all truth."
Or he was what he claimed to be.
I had to make that decision.
I couldn't prove it.
Thank you, and God bless all of you.
Thank you for the privilege. It was great.
Richard Wurman: You did it.

Suheir Hammad: Poems of war, peace, women, power
"What I Will" I will not dance to your war drum.
I will not dance to that beating.
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.
It was alive once, hunted, stolen, stretched.
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.
I will not pop, spin, break for you.
I will not hate for you or even hate you.
I will not kill for you.
Especially I will not die for you.
Everyone can be wrong.
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.
I will not forget where I come from.
I will craft my own drum.
Our humming will be drumming.
I will not be played.
This heartbeat is louder than death.
A bunch of pacifists.
Confused, aspiring pacifists.
I've been wrong a lot lately.
So I couldn't figure out what to read today.
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.
It preps you. It aims you.
Hold her now with you.
Are you holding her?
This is "Break Clustered."
All holy history banned.
Whose son shall it be?
Which male child will perish a new day?
Our boys' deaths galvanize.
We cherish corpses.
We mourn women, complicated.
Bitches get beat daily.
Profits made, prophets ignored.
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.
All colors run, none of us solid.
I live cycles of light and darkness.
Rhythm is half silence.
I see now, I never was one and not the other.
Sickness, health, tender violence.
I think now I never was pure.
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.
Girl spoiled before ripened.
Language can't math me.
I experience exponentially.
Everything is everything.
One woman loses six.
One woman loses her head.
One woman straps herself.
One woman gives birth to a baby.
One woman gives birth to borders.
One woman never did.
Where do refugee hearts go?
Faced with absence.
We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all.
My spine curves spiral.
Cluster bombs left behind.
De facto landmines.
A smoldering grief.
Harvest contaminated tobacco.
Harvest baby teeth.
Harvest palms, smoke.
Harvest witness, smoke.
Resolutions, smoke.
Do not fear what has blown up.
If you must, fear the unexploded.
global issues,peace,social change,women
I went to Northern Liberia.
She was the laughing stock of the community.
I wish for her to be a nurse."
With tears in my eyes, I said, "No."
When I asked, "Who is that?"
She said, "That's Wei.
The meaning of her name is pig.
I wish to go with you.
I wish to go to school."
She came to me bloated, very pale.
She's highly athletic.
Full scholarship. She gets it.
She goes to school on the first day.
Other countries come with different things.
Teen prostitution is at its peak.
It's disheartening, it's sad.
Today, we've worked with over 300.
Juanita is her name.
Says, "Leymah, my wish is to be educated.
I wish for a better life.
I wish for food for my children.
This is the dream of the African girl.
Several years ago, there was one African girl.
I will fulfill the wish.
This is another African girl's wish.
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.
I failed to do this.
This young woman wished also to go to school.
She went to school.
Today, this young woman is me, a Nobel laureate.
We set up a foundation.
I don't have much to ask of you.
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.
And we could not find 25 girls in high school.
And this was at the beginning of elections.
This is a real rural village.
They were able to mobilize young women.
He's out of office today.
LG: You're welcome.

Nigel Marsh: How to make work-life balance work
We should stop looking outside.
I'm talking about all companies.
Have breakfast with my wife and children.
Do three hours' work.
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.
Do another three hours' work.
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids.
Meditate for half an hour.
Walk the dog. Have sex again.
How often do you think I have that day?
We need to be realistic.
You can't do it all in one day.
A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.
There's got to be a middle way.
It's totally dominated by work.
I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.
All of my relationships have failed.
There's nothing in my life apart from my work.
So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.
So I joined a gym."
Now that can be daunting.
You want me to go to church and call my mother."
I truly understand how that can be daunting.
Now my point is the small things matter.
Moreover, I think, it can transform society.
And that, I think, is an idea worth spreading.
Majora Carter: Greening the ghetto
We garnered much support along the way.
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma.
These impacts are coming everyone's way.
Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto.
These things make me different from you.
So how did things get so different for us?
My dad was not alone.
600,000 people were displaced.
Now, why is this story important?
Think bike shops, juice stands.
Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused.
Green roofs are soil and living plants.
And they provide habitats for our little friends!
But I'll tell you later if you want to know.
This is my version of globalization.
He looked at the demographics.
We have no excuse in this country. I'm sorry.
Oh good, glad I have a little more time!
His response was a grant program.
I was making him an offer.
Now, don't get me wrong, we need money.
I have come from so far to meet you like this.
Hans Rosling's new insights on poverty
I told you three things last year.
And that animated graphics can make a difference.
So three things have happened.
And let me repeat what you saw last year.
The bubbles are the countries.
At that time there was a "we" and "them."
There was a huge difference in the world.
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
And this is what happens.
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.
The blue there is India.
And I will talk on, is this possible?
Because this is where we are.
Will it be possible that this will happen?
I cover my lifetime here, you know?
I expect to live 100 years.
And this is where we are today.
We'll swap the axis.
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.
Some countries still had statistics.
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
You see the importance of that?
And here, children don't live longer.
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
It moves this way over here.
Let us have a look at the United States.
They are on the money side all the time.
Chile's catching up!
And behind the health is the educational level.
And here we go. Here we go.
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
They really caught up.
And this changes gradually.
And this is my family.
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
And Sweden was like Mozambique.
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
Sweden was like Ghana.
I'm the Mexican in the family.
But they're very small, you know?
But homage to Singapore.
Singapore is the best one.
Now this looks also like a very good story.
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
And what happens when we moved on?
There is no one who has done it so far.
And there we are, 2001.
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
But from now on, we count per capita.
From now on we count per capita.
And this is really what has to be changed.
The world is quite a messy place.
This we can call Dollar Street.
Everyone lives on this street here.
This family earns about one dollar per day.
And how do they live?
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
This can change. This can change.
We can get out of poverty.
It's about having food.
That's one context.
Getting out of poverty.
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
It's also good with credit.
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
Africa has not done bad.
Because we don't consider where they came from.
We have to know a little more about the world.
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
He knows everything.
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
And I know 200, I know about the small data.
But you can do that.
You make a PowerPoint, you know?
Homage to the Office package, no?
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
Everyone wants your pet thing.
We need everything.
Education, human resources are important.
Environment is important.
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
And that's good, it gets two plusses.
Environment is very, very crucial.
But where are the important goals?
Of course, it's human rights.
That's the value of living.
So the seemingly impossible is possible.
Even African countries can achieve this.
We can have a good world.
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?
Mitch Resnick: Let's teach kids to code
So I started taking a look at them.
What do I mean by fluent?
And it's similar with new technologies.
But that doesn't really make you fluent.
It seems that everybody is getting into the act.
And that triggered a debate in the U.K.
But coding doesn't have to be like this.
And it doesn't just stay on the screen.
It uses the webcam.
And it's the same thing with coding.
If you learn to code, you can code to learn.
You learn more about how computers work.
But that's just where it starts.
Let me show you an example.
He wanted to keep score.
I'll call it score.
And it's in fact working.
It's nothing that, really, they can make use of.
Now he had a reason for learning variables.
Very few people become professional writers.
Again, the same thing with coding.
And it's not just about your work life.
Let me end with just one more example.
It's scratch.mit.edu, and give a try at coding.
Chris Bangle says great cars are Art
This is completely different than automobiles.
Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?
There we go, the automobile.
I want to talk about this.
We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
You can understand that. It works in truisms.
"All is fair in design and war."
Certainly we live in a competitive society.
You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.
This is sick beyond belief.
You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
Someone's love, someone's baby.
There was a whole lot of dialog.
I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
That's what you get furious about right?
I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
Jay Bradner: Open-source cancer research
The bar is called the Miracle of Science.
The billboards say "Lab Space Available."
This information is also pretty staggering.
We didn't fly him to Boston.
We didn't sequence his genome.
It's three proteins -- Ras, Myc and P53.
There's no Ras, no Myc, no P53 drug.
And you might fairly ask: why is that?
It's a horrible term of trade.
And this is the 21st century.
Now BRD4 is an interesting protein.
It remembers that it's cancer.
And so we started to work on this problem.
We just started mailing it to our friends.
I have a small lab.
They were changing shape.
This got us very excited.
And every time, we see the same thing.
And so we did just the opposite.
We told people exactly how to make it.
And this was, unfortunately, successful.
You might know that fat has memory.
Nice to be able to demonstrate that for you.
We have this molecule, but it's not a pill yet.
It's not orally available.
For us, a major and exciting milestone.
I want to leave you with just two ideas.
Yet this information is largely a secret.
Now the business model involves all of you.
This research is funded by the public.
It's funded by foundations.
The universe is really big.
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.
100 billion is the only number you need to know.
It's extremely beautiful.
But we would also like to understand it.
So we say the universe is expanding.
That kind of makes sense to us.
You might think that that's not a surprise.
The air in this room is very smooth.
In particular, things were a lot denser.
There is something that made it that way.
We would like to know what.
You've heard of entropy.
We'd like to understand that.
That's our job as cosmologists.
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.
We learned that it's accelerating.
The universe is not only expanding.
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.
For one thing, the universe will expand forever.
Einstein was fond of this idea.
Finally, empty space has a temperature.
Well what is the implication of that?
But that's a probabilistic statement.
It's very, very unlikely.
But there will also be large fluctuations.
That's the region where entropy is low.
But he was not right.
So this scenario makes predictions.
And Feynman also understood this.
I just showed you this picture.
They will fall into black holes.
The future is much longer than the past.
But even black holes don't last forever.
That empty space lasts essentially forever.
So here's two questions for you.
Why aren't we in empty space?
More homework assignment for you.
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.
That's my favorite scenario.
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.

William Kamkwamba: How I harnessed the wind
It was a simple machine that changed my life.
I had never used a computer.
I had never seen an Internet.
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.
My English lost, I wanted to vomit.
There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.
But well, I'm feeling good right now.
I would like to share that story today.
We have seven children in my family.
All sisters, excepting me.
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.
Like everyone else, we grew maize.
One year our fortune turned very bad.
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.
My family ate one meal per day, at night.
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.
The food passes through our bodies.
We drop down to nothing.
It was the future I couldn't accept.
So I went to a library.
I read books, science books, especially physics.
I couldn't read English that well.
Another book put that knowledge in my hands.
I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes.
It was one light at first.
Another machine pumps water for irrigation.
I could not get rid of them.
I had never seen an airplane before.
I had never slept in a hotel.
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.
Whatever happens, don't give up.
demo,design,open-source,technology
It comes as a part of our everyday learning.
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs.
What we are interested in is information.
We want to know about things.
You can start painting on any wall.
But we are not only tracking one finger, here.
This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.
You can of course watch movies.
Paper world is interesting to play with.
That's all. Thank you.
This is incredible, really.
Or is this research forever, or what?
CA: Open source? Wow.
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.
CA: What are your plans? MIT?
It's an honor to have you at TED.
Denis Dutton: A Darwinian theory of beauty
It's in the eye of the beholder.
It's whatever moves you personally.
Beethoven is adored in Japan.
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
How can we explain this universality?
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
It did not evolve for natural survival.
In fact, it goes against natural survival.
It's quite a familiar story.
It's women who actually push history forward.
He actually used that word.
But, someone might argue, that's natural beauty.
How about artistic beauty?
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
No, I don't think it is.
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes.
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
What were these artifacts for?
It's hard to grasp, but it's an incredible fact.
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.
We find beauty in something done well.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
No, it's deep in our minds.
design,technology,transportation
Dennis Hong: Making a car for blind drivers
We have already an autonomous vehicle.
We couldn't have been more wrong.
It was an absolutely amazing experience.
So we have three steps.
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.
And we also use three laser range finders.
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.
Another device is called SpeedStrip.
So this is not really freedom, right?
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.
So basically that's how it works.
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look.
Announcer: This is an historic day in January.
There's the grandstand now.
Well there comes the first box.
Now let's see if Mark avoids it.
He does. He passes it on the right.
Third box is out. The fourth box is out.
Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.
Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel.
Mark Riccobono: Yes.
You must be out of your mind."
And I truly believe that this can happen.
How are we going to handle insurance?
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?
Yves Behar on designing objects that tell stories
And then there was another influence.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
I mean, look at those graphics there.
"You know, do people really use it?
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"
And I didn't want to be a colorist.
It wasn't what I wanted to do.
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
And this is what we're pursuing here.
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
It's really about designing from the inside out.
And it's what I call being design driven.
And then, of course, design is never done.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
This picture is incredible.
I mean, to me, it just means so much.
And I think this is something really important.
And we went away from obviously the beige.
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.
Like paper, paper and cardboard.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
Of course, clubs and discos, too.
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.
How will we be remembered in 200 years?
It happened 225 years ago.
It's the child that's remembered.
And that's what we're going through at this time.
That will blow away a lot of the opposition.
So, let's leave that aside.
It's not only cold, but very dry.
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.
That's something we don't yet know how to do.
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
So there's no point in looking."
There is something called pit lamping.
You take -- that's a Canadian expression.
I call these creatures sunflowers.
They look like, maybe like sunflowers.
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.
That would be a fun thing to do.
Eric Whitacre: Virtual Choir Live
I took a couple victory laps in there.
Now fast forward to just three years ago.
Could we do this all in real time?
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.
We deal in milliseconds.

Kavita Ramdas: Radical women, embracing tradition
I am interested in how women are saving us.
Or are they one and the same?
And what, if anything, do men have to do with it?
But you're young, you could still try again."
A flock of relatives descended on her.
They took off her colorful sari.
They made her wear a white one.
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.
They broke her bangles.
This is tradition."
And men are affected by those rules too.
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."
Was a women's rights advocate invoking religion?
But Sakena defies labels.
She is also immensely pragmatic.
She is on the Taliban's hit list.
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.
I also like rock and roll.
So Lesbor, we blend the two.
One night, she had a dream.
They were all tired of the fighting.
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.
Layma and her sisters had had enough.
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
Then things get tense.
You can see the policeman's face.
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.
And the peace accord was signed.
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
That's the heat from the bottom.
But we also need the heat from the top.
They have to negotiate.
And they need allies from their communities.
We can use our tradition to navigate change.
And she is definitely on her way.

Hannah Brencher: Love letters to strangers
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?
If you ever need one, just carry one of these.
Find me when you can."
Lee Cronin: Print your own medicine
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?
Now what could this mean?
So how are we doing this in the lab?
So what could this mean?
You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.
We can print drugs at point of need.
We can download new diagnostics.
Say a new super bug has emerged.
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.
Beam me up, Scotty.
Islam,culture,religion
Mustafa Akyol: Faith versus tradition in Islam
There was no separation of sexes.
They were together while praying.
And I noticed this in a very funny way.
I headed to the nearest Burger King restaurant.
Ironic, and it's also, I think, quite telling.
But apparently that was not an issue at the time.
So the rituals came that way.
There is a practice called female circumcision.
It's something terrible, horrible.
It was there for thousands of years.
The Muslims in North Africa, not in other places.
It should be the citizen's decision.
And there are strengths in Islamic tradition.
You can derive many ideas from that.
The Koran, for example, doesn't condone stoning.
There is no punishment on apostasy.
It's our faith, and we will be loyal to it.
But that's not the case at all.
They said, "Why don't we have these things?"
The context has changed.
And when you have colonization what do you have?
You have anti-colonization.
That's one thing to remember.
Of course, this is a long road.
But this is a promising era in the Muslim world.
They just should be allowed to work for that.
Frans Lanting's lyrical nature photos
Nature's my muse and it's been my passion.
But five years ago, I went on a personal journey.
I wanted to visualize the story of life.
But there were also revelations.
Stromatolites are the heroes in my story.
solidifying into surface, molded by fire.
The moon was closer; things were different.
And when it vanishes, Earth becomes Mars.
It arises around cracks in the Earth.
Learn to multiply, thickening in places ...
Growing living structures under an alien sky ...
Stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen.
And they changed the atmosphere.
A breath that's fossilized now as iron.
circuit boards of the future.
It grew as light and oxygen increased.
Life hardened and became defensive.
Lichens arose as a co-op. Fungi married algae ...
True land plants arose, leafless at first.
Life flourished in swamps.
Life turned hard so it could venture inland.
Forests arose and nurtured things with wings.
And others fly today like echoes of the past.
In birds, life gained new mobility.
Water lilies were among the first.
In Africa, Gondwana molded Proteas.
a trick shared by the largest flower on Earth.
When birds can't fly, they become vulnerable.
But there were witnesses, survivors in the dark.
When the skies cleared, a new world was born.
New forms became bats. Civets.
Grasslands created opportunities.
Herd safety came with sharpened senses.
Some mammals turned back to water.
And cetaceans moved into a world without bounds.
We're molded by the same life force.
Stefan Wolff: The path to ending ethnic conflicts
But let's start at the beginning.
So are these now the images of the past?
But this trend is less unambiguous.
This is a decrease by two-thirds.
And the big question, of course, is why?
But let's look at the good news again.
Take the example of Northern Ireland.
A final example: Kosovo.
Central among them are three.
Third, institutional design.
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.
His people live in Brazil and in Peru.
We wanted to share our stories with each other.
His grandfather died when he was only 10.
Some did, not everybody.
But he wasn't dismayed.
Why are you putting yourself at risk?
And what am I doing?"
We know we are running out of what we need.
We're running out of fresh water.
We're running out of fossil fuels.
We're running out of land.
We don't know how, but we know it will.
We are running out of what we need.
But you know all that.
Things are bad enough as they are."
I started life as a banker.
This is Sanghamitra.
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
She loved it, but she was too detached.
Even that wasn't enough.
She works with people like Murali Krishna.
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.
And they sit around, and they talk about dreams.
It's the spirit inside."
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.
Why did he do all this?
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
But he doesn't want his nation ever to forget.
They didn't go to business school.
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.
They have drive, passion, commitment.
And they have humility.
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?
I think it has to start with us.
And we know, just like they knew, how hard it is.
We can look at what they've done, if we look.
We can learn from what they've learned.

"How come?" said Kartikeya.
'My world' is subjective.
It's emotional. It's personal.
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.
It is the belief system that we carry.
It's the myth that we live in.
Yours is illogical.
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.
This river lends itself to India's name.
We don't know who he was.
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."
And they both laughed.
Each one thought that the other was a fool.
What a waste of a life."
That's what he heard.
"What should you not be?
He heard a very different story.
Bharat also conquered the world.
that's what I thought until I came here."
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
They were two lifetimes of the same hero.
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.
When Ram dies, Krishna is born.
But you don't cross it once.
You go to and fro endlessly.
It was called the Vaitarani.
You go again and again and again.
And what do you do at the end of 10 days?
You dunk it in the river.
Because it has to end.
And next year, she will come back.
Two different mythologies.
One linear, one cyclical.
One believes this is the one and only life.
The other believes this is one of many lives.
So, no matter what he did, it was always zero.
And that brings us to the mythology of business.
And then look at business.
And if you comply, you will go to heaven.
But in India there is no "the" promised land.
It's always about taste.
It's always about my taste.
There is no orchestra conductor.
It is not about documentation and contract.
It's about conversation and faith.
And people are okay with it.
And then globalization is taking place.
Which is rooted in one-life culture.
It is bound to happen.
I love mythology too much.
So, I had to teach it to myself.
And mythology does not pay, well, until now.
And I worked in the healthcare industry.
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
How do you parameterize "mostly"?
I would give my viewpoints to people.
But belief is not measurable.
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.
So, how do you construct belief?
And I will share one of the rituals with you.
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.
You want to see God.
So, I will not answer the question.
Varuna has but a thousand eyes.
You and I, only two.
Thank you. Namaste.
David Pogue on cool phone tricks
I review gadgets and stuff.
Now, it works just like a regular phone.
The little box has your phone number.
It's not your phone -- it's your computer.
I can't figure out why!
Actually, I need to update that. There's one now.
It comes from T-Mobile.
And I am not paid by T-Mobile.
I'm not plugging T-Mobile.
It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.
"Hi, we have an announcement to -- WAH!!!"
The answer is, "All the time!"
They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.
We're putting it in our homes for them!
Anyway, they have Wi-Fi phones in Europe.
: Jennifer Pogue: Hello?
David Pogue: Hi babes, it's me.
JP: Oh, hi darling, how are you?
DP: You're on Wi-Fi. How does it sound?
JP: Oh, it sounds pretty good.
DP: What are you guys doing?
It also works the other way.
This is another favorite of mine.
Excuse me one second.
Oh. Where are you calling from?
All right! We've made the point.
I have your numbers now!
The beauty of that is you never miss a call.
Very, very customizable.
Did you know that? It's an outrage.
I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.
What you're going to use is Google Cellular.
It's totally free -- there's not even ads.
Leave off the last "e" for savings.
You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.
It works with weather, too.
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
Here we go. And those are just the beginning.
So I'm going to teach you something even better.
This is called Google Info.
So lets say I'm in Monterey, and I want what?
I want to find what? Bagels. OK.
Google: Say the business and the city and state.
DP: Bagels, Monterey, California.
I got the Chinese line.
Google: Bagels, Monterey, California.
Number two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.
Number Two. Number Two. Two.
Why do I listen to people in the audience?
Well anyway -- oh! Here we go!
I'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."
DP: Hi, could I have 400 with a schmear?
No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.
So anyway, you never even find out the number.
It's just so amazing.
And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
This you can ask by voice any question.
Who won the 1958 World Series?
What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?
"Which actors have played James Bond?"
Just to see how the recognition was.
They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."
Because there is one!
That's who can afford to do that.
You know. It's just absolutely amazing.
Nobody has pagers anymore.
"You may begin speaking at the tone.
Of course I want to listen to the messages!
Oh! You all have cell phones too.
Sorry. I'm not bitter.
It is a life-changer.
So you be the judge.
So I thought I'd see how that goes.
This is me testing it out.
: Hello, this is Michael.
I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.
She's in room -- emergency room 53W.
OK, talk to you later -- bye.
So a couple minutes later, this I got by email.
So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
Well I guess that was the gist.
And lastly, I just have to talk about this one.
Here's the girlfriend.
Phone: Hey you, what's going on?
DP: I'm kinda, like, giving a talk right now.
Phone: Well, that's good.
DP: What are you doing?
Phone: I was just wondering what you were up to.
DP: Right, I can't really talk right now.
This is the -- I love this -- the boss call.
DP: Oh -- sorry I forgot.
DP: It was like three weeks ago.
I know the people who worked on the Treo.
It was not very conducive to innovation.
Finally Cingular said OK.
I'm going to talk about the effect of the iPhone.
- you know. I'm not.
I don't understand why we're not there yet.
What's the problem?
Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.
It's like, "It only has one button.
Touch it and it dials a number at random."
"Who the hell is this?"
It downloads right to the phone.
You know how you erase it?
Of course. You shake it.
They have 10,000 of these programs.
This is amazing. This is Midomi.
I know. It's insane, right?
It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
You say if you like this song or not.
It eventually only plays songs you like.
You want to find a place to eat. You shake it.
It proposes a restaurant.
Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.
Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.
Of course, its not just about the iPhone.
The iPhone broke the dyke, the wall.
Touch screen -- very, very nice.
Can I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.
Sorry, that was mean.
And now the end is near.
I'm sick to death of this old cell phone.
A made-in-Hell phone.
I too will join the cult.
But God, this thing is sweet.
A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.
You had me from, "Hello."
I want to touch its precious screen.
I want to wipe the smudges clean.
I want my friends to look and drool.
It's all the things a phone should be.
Who cares if it's AT&T?
I took a stand, paid half a grand!
And I got an iPhone!

Do you know which group you're in?
If you don't, you're not alone.
But first, my disclosures.
I am not a breast cancer survivor.
I'm not a radiologist.
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines.
But in my view, the radiologists are heroes.
But that very fact is telling.
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?
But what else could I offer her?
What about ultrasound?
Think about iPods compared to stereos.
But it's the exact opposite in health care.
It's just way too much equipment.
It's like the essence of TED.
This is an image from our first patient.
This is our current detector.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
So how does this work?
So here's an example.
Our big break came in 2004.
MBI found 83 percent.
Here's an example from that screening study.
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
It's also older women with dense tissue.
MBI generates four images per breast.
MRI generates over a thousand.
First, know your density.
Of course we should.
http://www.ted.com/talks/damon_horowitz.html
culture,philosophy,technology
That is the word that comes to mind.
We're the new technologists.
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power.
How much power do we have?
That's the kind of power I feel in this room.
Let's take an example.
What can we do with just one person's data?
What can we do with that guy's data?
I can look at your financial records.
I can tell if you pay your bills on time.
I know if you're good to give a loan to.
I can look at your clicking patterns.
I'm here to talk about what we should do.
What's the right thing to do?
But it brings me back.
So what should we be doing with that guy's data?
So we can make money?
How should we figure it out?
I know: crowdsource. Let's crowdsource this.
Let's do a show of hands -- iPhone.
Next question, a little bit harder.
Or should we leave him alone?
You're safe. It's fine.
Yeah, that's a terrifying result.
What's a moral operating system?
We all know right and wrong, right?
But how do we figure out what's right and wrong?
Maybe we just follow our gut.
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource.
So let's get a moral framework.
We're numbers people, living by numbers.
I know a guy who did exactly that.
A brilliant guy -- he's been dead 2,500 years.
Plato, that's right.
Remember him -- old philosopher?
You were sleeping during that class.
He was worried about right and wrong.
He wanted to know what is just.
I don't want opinions; I want knowledge.
In math, we know the objective facts.
Take a number, any number -- two.
Favorite number. I love that number.
There are truths about two.
They all participate in the truths that two has.
They all have two-ness in them.
And therefore, it's not a matter of opinion.
What if, Plato thought, ethics was like math?
What if there were a pure form of justice?
That's a stunning vision.
That's as ambitious as we are.
He wants to solve ethics.
He wants objective truths.
Aristotle, in particular, he was not amused.
He thought it was impractical.
Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math.
If you think that, Plato's not your guy.
That sound familiar?
That's a utilitarian moral framework.
But here's the way it works.
It does something intrinsic to the act.
It's not like its relation to some abstract form.
It's just a matter of the consequences.
That would be simple. Then we know what to do.
I thought, that guy looks suspicious.
But maybe you don't feel that way either.
Maybe you think, it's his phone.
It doesn't matter what the calculations are.
It's not a matter of calculation.
So let's cut to the chase.
How should we be making our decisions?
What should we be doing? What's the answer?
What's the formula?
There's not a formula.
There's not a simple answer.
Ethics requires thinking.
And that's uncomfortable.
We're the ones who have to do it.
Happily, we're not machines, and we can do it.
Not only can we think, we must.
It arises from not thinking."
That's what she called the "banality of evil."
So let's do that. Let's think.
In fact, let's start right now.
What did I do? Did I follow my gut?
Or now we have a few more choices.
Now the next step -- try this.
Not right now. Wait till I finish talking.
In fact, find somebody from the humanities.
It's based on Norse legend.
That's interesting.
And we care about right and wrong.
We care what happens in that opera.
We care what happens in "Apocalypse Now."
We're the ones writing this opera.
We determine how this will all end.
business,cities,culture,economics,race
Steven Levitt analyzes crack economics
So there are three things I want to do.
It's an interesting story, I think.
It contains adult themes, adult language.
In the early '80s, some would say.
But there was no money in it, OK?
The gang had no way to make money.
Marijuana's too cheap, it turns out.
You can't get rich selling marijuana.
You couldn't sell cocaine.
You couldn't really do petty crime, either.
And so it wasn't really a career.
Then along comes crack cocaine.
I don't have time to talk about it today.
It had a huge impact on life.
So what was it about crack cocaine?
It was a brilliant way of getting the brain high.
Highly addictive -- the high was very short.
So for fifteen minutes, you get this great high.
It created a wonderful market.
At least for the people in the top.
So this is where we enter the picture.
And, in his own words, he "looked like a freak."
He was really a curious sight to be seen.
So he showed up at the University of Chicago.
Gets to the first building.
The first building? Well, there's nobody there.
This is about 1990 -- peak of the crack epidemic.
Now, Sudhir was lucky.
Makes you wonder about academics, OK?
He was held hostage overnight in the stairwell.
So Sudhir went home. Took a shower, took a nap.
We really got access to everybody in the gang.
And they made them available to us.
They are the entrepreneurs.
Extremely dangerous work.
OK, just like McDonald's.
It really is not fiction -- it's fact.
Truly, you would be a great success story.
This was the best way out.
The money looks about the same.
Why is it such a bad job?
That is about as high as you can get.
That's extremely high.
It used to be the gang was a rite of passage.
They never passed on any of the wealth.
That 14-year-old kid would say: "Oh, well ..."
So I have a couple minutes.
So economists tend to talk in technical words.
Here's an economic principle.
It's exactly this concept.
Because they're not willing to be at risk.
Here's another one.
They're going to come into your neighborhood.
So that's exactly the same concept.
The gang leader always got paid, OK?
Ueli Gegenschatz soars in a wingsuit
I started with paragliding.
From there I started with skydiving.
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.
From there I went on to wingsuit flying.
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side.
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.
You need to have the best possible equipment.
Enjoy, and thank you very much.
June Cohen: I have some questions.
I think we all might have some questions.
Because it looks like it might.
It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet.
UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.
And I believe soon.
UE: Nope. It's just smoke.
JC: Coming off of you?
JC: That seems dangerous.
What do you do to to cover your face?
Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles?
JC: And is that how you usually fly?
So you have to be prepared.
JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?
and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to."
UE: Thank you very much.
Olafur Eliasson: Playing with space and light
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.
I have occasional meetings with scientists.
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.
Who decides what reality is?
This is the Tate Modern in London.
The show was, in a sense, about that.
And my idea was to make the space tangible.
So look at this. Look at the girl.
"Oh! That was my foot there!"
How do we reconfigure it?
"What does it matter?"
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
And the water flows through the city with time.
And if I vote it makes a difference.
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."
The difference between thinking and doing.
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.
These are ongoing experiments.
It's made out of ice.
It's quite simple and fundamental.
I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.
The big mountains far away, they move less.
And your body somehow knows that.
And why would we want to do that?
Is there a sense of consequences?
It's about being together.
How do we create public space?
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?
So what is between thinking and doing?
Experience is about responsibility.
Having an experience is taking part in the world.
That's all I have. Thank you very much.
literature,music,performance,poetry
Natalie Merchant sings old poems to life
Taking them off the dead, flat pages.
Bringing them to life, bringing them to light.
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
And here's her poem.
The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
One was his daughter, Laurence.
Gerard Manley Hopkins, a saintly man.
He became a Jesuit.
He converted from his Anglican faith.
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
everyone that blew my mind this week.
Just bring it down a little.
I still have two minutes.
Okay, we're going to start that verse again.
I have so much admiration for him.
I'll show you how to clap to this song.
Gradually, bringing it down, bringing it down.

Israel and Iran: A love story?
And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
And I was like, "What's going on?"
We don't know people from Iran.
And now people from Iran are talking to me.
And everybody's crying now.
Because it's working, put me in a poster now.
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."
It was a huge amount of pictures.
So for a few days, that's how my living room was.
If it's an image, they may read it.
So here are a few of them.
They have graphic designers. What?
So. And now it's communication.
And it became really big at some point.
And then it became news.
Who is everybody?" "Everybody."
They said, "Syria?" "Syria."
"Lebanon?" "Lebanon."
It's everybody." The Chinese.
And we were just at the beginning of the story.
Something crazy also happened.
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.
We really changed how people see the Middle East.
Because you're not in the Middle East.
And for a few days you got those images.
They see images of us, and they see bad images.
And it's going both ways.
And we're understanding. And you show compassion.
And you become friends.
You can go and travel and meet people.
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
And that was the end of it.
Remember that image from the beginning?
And it goes the other way around.
Just read where those guys are from.
Just people sending their pictures.
So -- So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
I know how it can look really bad.
And really, we can be our own ambassadors.
We can just send a message and hope for the best.
Just raise that. Exactly.
architecture,creativity,design,environment,green
Bjarke Ingels: 3 warp-speed architecture tales
He triggered the modernist revolution.
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.
Only the best ones can survive.
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.
It doesn't really work in this context.
So as a result, we never throw anything out.
You never know when you might need it.
And we saw this guy, Haibao.
We even double checked.
So the People's Building, as we called it.
And we had the chance to explain the project.
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.
China symbolized by the dragon.
Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.
Copenhagen, Shanghai, modern, European.
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.
A third of all the people commute by bike.
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
So quite often you load water for ballast.
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.
This is my apartment.
This is our first architectural model.
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.
They can actually have both.
So we took the commission.
We quite often make little movies.
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.
They create shelter from the wind.
They accumulate the solar energy.
They accumulate the water.
Yes, maybe just to round off.
Bjorn Lomborg sets global priorities
So get out your pen and paper.
I'm just going to list some of them.
There are 800 million people starving.
Two billion people without sanitation.
The lists go on and on.
There are many, many problems out there.
We don't actually solve all problems.
And that's the question I'd like to ask you.
Where should we start on solving these problems?
But that's a wrong problem to ask.
Because we can't solve problems.
To climate change that would be like Kyoto.
What should be at the bottom of the list?
Nobody wants to do this.
We have not had an idea.
We'd like to know these things.
Likewise in communicable diseases.
What would be the price?
We called them the "dream team."
And then you ask, why economists?
That is what economists do.
These were the bad projects.
Why is it it came up?
It's not saying that it's not a big problem.
That's a substantial amount of money.
Yet it would do very little good.
Which is a little good, but not very much good.
And that is really why it becomes a bad project.
This third best one was free trade.
That would be the third best thing we could do.
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
But of course, we don't do all problems.
There are many problems out there in the world.
And of course, we'll be even richer than that.
It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
I think we should do all things, but we don't.
Since then our aid has halved.
We've done this many other times.
They all come out with very much the same list.
I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
arts,design,film,happiness
The serif is not really in place.
That climate plays no role.
You will adapt to it and get used to it.
Now this does matter.
We become what we really are interested in.
This is just completely ridiculous."
So I am looking still for a Stephanie.
I'll figure something out.
I'm a big list maker, so I came up with a list.
One of them is to think without pressure.
But also because the content was very close.
Suzanne Lee: Grow your own clothes
So we start by brewing the tea.
And then we're ready to add the living organism.
And along with that, some acetic acid.
So this is my mini fabric farm.
And this is a static culture.
It doesn't need light.
At this point, it's really heavy.
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
And using indigo, make it anti-microbial.
What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
Align it in this direction.
Make it hydrophobic.
So we only grow what we need.
This is one of the jackets you grew?
It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.
Leslie T. Chang: The voices of China's workers
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?
Their calculations are different.
How long should I stay in this factory?
How much money can I save?
Leslie Chang: One minute?
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.
Carolyn Porco: Could a Saturn moon harbor life?
So we are very encouraged by these results.

The Taliban now run their own schools.
Hazrat Ali is from a poor farming family in Swat.
He joined the Taliban a year ago when he was 13.
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.
HA: If God gives me strength.
This boy is called Zenola.
He blew himself up, killing six.
This boy is called Sadik.
This boy is called Messoud.
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?
Boy: I would love to.
But only if I get permission from my dad.
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."
Then God will look at my intention.
Internet,business,exploration,technology
Andrew Blum: What is the Internet, really?
You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
You can experience their sense of place.
We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
And then this happened.
A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."
But that in fact seemed to be the case.
A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet.
Could I go there? Who would I meet?
You know, was there something actually out there?
And the answer, by all accounts, was no.
It wasn't a real world out there.
There's a very short list of these places.
And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
And then they connect to the continent somewhere.
It's an intensely, intensely physical process.
And that doesn't seem right.
business,design,technology
Lisa Harouni: A primer on 3D printing
This is a 3D printer.
Many barriers are breaking down.
They were all 3D printed.
The design is quite extraordinary.
This is almost three meters high.
And you can actually walk into it.
So really the resolution is quite incredible.
There's very little economies of scale.
So you can now create one-offs very easily.
Again, not buildable in any other way.
And very hard to even create this by hand.
Now this is an engine component.
And it's used by aerospace and automotive.
There's a lower chance of rejection.
You're having machines fabricate themselves.
You can just make it physically on the spot.
Brands like Nike are doing it.
It's all over the Web.
And you can start iterating the design.
But I don't think that that's immediate.
I don't think that will happen soon.
This means lower carbon footprint.
Here's the product being built.
It's this lamp, as you can see here.
It's very intricate.
So just to finalize, we're all individual.
We like different things.
Businesses want different things.
Jacqueline Novogratz on escaping poverty
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
And it was here that I met Jane.
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
In 2001, her life changed.
She started tailoring.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.
And so she can't move out.
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
And she said, "What would I miss?
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.
We owe it to the Janes of the world.
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
Matt Cutts: Try something new for 30 days
The idea is actually pretty simple.
Have you ever wanted to write a novel?
Now is my book the next great American novel?
No. I wrote it in a month.
So here's one last thing I'd like to mention.
There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges.
In fact, they're a ton of fun.
But they're less likely to stick.
energy,invention,technology
Bill Gross on new energy
There was gas rationing in 1973.
The energy crisis was in full bore.
That got me very excited.
So, I started this company called Solar Devices.
But they didn't believe me.
First, the coursework at Caltech.
So what about making energy?
Maybe we could make energy.
So, that's a breakthrough.
I'll be very short on genetic algorithms.
And I'll show you what we came up with.
Traditionally, concentrators look like this.
Those shapes are parabolas.
And this is the shape that evolved.
We needed to beat solar cells.
So we took a look at another idea.
But, his refinements were incredible.
Those were major breakthroughs.
Another type of engine is the hot air engine.
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.
That's a heat engine.
We applied the genetic algorithm.
Let me show you what it looks like in real life.
So this is the engine.
The exact converse is also true.
So now you put the two things together.
It doesn't really care.
and you also get hot water.
The hot water's optional.
This is the map of the United States.
And of course, look at Africa.
It just makes economic sense.
Basically, oil is solar energy concentrate.
Maira Kalman, the illustrated woman
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
And we started a studio.
And the books are really journals of my life.
I never -- I don't like plots.
I don't know what a plot means.
The letter C had other things in it.
Who are these people? What are these tribes?
I said, people should know about this book.
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
Do you mind my asking a question?"
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
I happen to know it for a fact.
You don't even know.
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
Well, not so awful.
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
It is February and not lying is impossible."
How do we know when we are ourselves?
I'm going to quickly go through this.
A complicated question.
Oh my God, you know what?
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
And she said, "I knew it was he."
Gershwin died at the age of 38.
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
I don't want to talk about that now.
And I would like to run it for them.
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
And then I go and have some tea.
That's actually Hy.
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic.
We blow it up and look at the pieces.
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
But still, we look at the pieces.
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations.
And this is the tower from below.
We have to get special flight clearance.
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.
Hod Lipson builds "self-aware" robots
So, where are the robots?
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.
So what can we do about that? What can we say?
Let's see what evolution can do for us.
But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.
So, we'll move forward to a different idea.

Laurie Garrett on lessons from the 1918 flu
What is it that we're concerned about?
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.
For example, all masks are made in China.
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.
Alright, so I've got you nervous.
And we have spent a lot of money.
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
So what have people been doing with this money?
Exercises, drills, all over the world.
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.
Let's everybody run around and play your role.
Nobody knows the chain of command.
The rest is up to your local community.
Everything is about your town, where you live.
And you'll have massive competition.
The vaccine will probably be useless.
So here's where the decisions come in.
You're the mayor of your local town.
What about quarantine?
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?
Nobody was processing the credit cards.
Your insurance payments didn't go through.
And that's just office workers, bankers.
It wasn't flying microbes.
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
Every city, county, state did their own thing.
Overall we lost 700,000 people.
It was likened to the plague.
We don't actually know how many people died.
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.
As a nation, no we're not.
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.
How many masks do you need?
I don't think that's rational.
But can you sustain your company that way?
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
Otherwise you're in trouble.
Happy to take your questions.
But I would say that honestly we don't know.
It's a very complicated ecology.
You know way more than any of us.
Can you talk about that?
But we do not completely understand why.
The mechanism isn't clear.
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.
I'm thinking dipstick.
It tells you if you have H5N1.
Is that likely, do you think, here?
I mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe.
Again we don't really know for sure.
But we don't really know.
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.

Sanjay Dastoor: A skateboard, with a boost
So we built something.
I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here.
So this is the motor.
These are from remote control airplanes.
It's incredible just how light this thing is.
Nalini Nadkarni on conserving the canopy
So, recolonization is really very slow.
These canopy communities are fragile.
How can I reconnect people with trees?"
Well, I think that I can do something.
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.
And my feeling is -- Thank you.
The results have been fantastic.
I'll just give you a few examples.
We've had dance people up in the canopy.
They made a fabulous dance called "Biome."
So this whole industry is unsustainable.
What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?
And they have become excellent partners.
The best I can imagine.
They were very enthusiastic.
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.

The children looked and were amazed.
They behaved just like the children.
And so she set about to make it so.
Well, guess what? I won. Hooray.
Well, it just can't. That's it.
You know, they're just not going to get it.
They're not magic. They are not our parents.
Because that is what Julian Assange did.
You've got to have skepticism and humility.
I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.
At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose.
I would like us to work towards that.
It was just, "Because I say so.
You have to trust me. Take it on faith."
They've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras.
Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
Richard Pyle dives the reef's Twilight Zone
It was taken 18 years ago.
I was 19 years old at the time.
I learned two really important things that day.
But, this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
I'll get into why that is in just a minute.
I want to find out what's in this zone.
We know almost nothing about it.
So, I'm just going to show you a basic idea.
So, basically the gas dissolves into our body.
There're three basic limitations of scuba diving.
The nitrogen has two problems.
It's nitrogen narcosis.
It makes you loopy.
The deeper you go, the loopier you get.
So that's the basic concept that we use.
But, the theory's relatively easy.
The tricky part is the implementation.
So, this is how I began, about 15 years ago.
We needed more time.
There had to be a better way.
And, indeed, there is a better way.
One, they're quiet, they don't make any noise.
Two, they allow you to stay underwater longer.
Three, they allow you to go deeper.
How is it that they do that?
So that's the breathing loop in a nutshell.
So that's where we get our nitrogen from.
You need voting logic.
You also have three microprocessors.
I'm going to take you on a deep dive.
It's kind of like skydiving in slow motion.
There's a just-unbelievable diversity.
It's not just fish, either.
This is Papua, New Guinea.
And we're not quite sure why.
Video: Look at those ...
I think we have their attention.
Diver 2: Uh, silvertip sharks.
And yes, it's a little nerve-wracking.
That little guy is frisky!
There's a lot of other ways you can die.
And I'm not making that stuff up.
And this is my favorite line from the article.
But, it's much more than that.
That's half-a-million dollars per pound.
Here's another new angelfish we discovered.
We were at 360 feet.
It's sort of like sobering up.
I think that's a new species."
And this is another neat one.
Now, this one's pretty cool.
This was taken exactly 300 feet above my head.
He had made a very simple mistake.
He had an oxygen toxicity seizure and he drowned.
You have to balance those two goals.
So, you can't live your life in fear.
I thought that was an old one.

And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
But here's what really perplexed me.
It seemed so intuitive to me.
One more mind will be unlocked.
Nora York sings "What I Want"
Jill Tarter's call to join the SETI search
So, my question: are we alone?
Perspective is a very powerful thing.
Perspectives can change.
Perspectives can be altered.
Is it really just us?
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.
But, what if we're not?
So, what exactly is SETI?
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.
Remember, one billion?
Alright, one billion stars.
Well, what about 10^22?
Where's the line that marks that?
So, there are many possibilities.
The first is that problems are inevitable.
The second is that problems are soluble.
Let me talk about a relatively small number.
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.
This is a very good year.
So, what would change everything?
So, we have a fulfillment problem.
That brings me to my wish.
Nathaniel Kahn on "My Architect"
We only meet them once.
They play off each other in a wonderful way.
He built the capital over there.
We were the first film crew in there.
So you'll see images of this remarkable building.
It took as long as the Taj Mahal.
The building was finished in 1983.
So it continued on for many years after he died.
So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.
NK: Did you hear that, really?
FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome.
Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.
But he was a sort of a nomad at heart.
We are proud of it.
NK: You're proud of it?
Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh.
NK: Do you know anything about the architect?
Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan?
NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn.
Man: Louis Kahn, yes!
Man: Your father, is he alive?
NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years.
Man: Very pleased to welcome you back.
NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.
No, he never saw this.
In that way it is so relevant.
NK: It cost him his life.
But he was also human.
You have to understand that.
Amory Lovins on winning the oil endgame
That's called a profit.
And whale oil lit practically every building.
They're not going to export your uncle's Buick.
And after that comes India.
The question is, who will make them?
That seems to make more sense.
So that's a very handsome return.
It's financeable in the private capital market.
They make a little net money for the treasury.
You can sort of have it all with these things.
Again, much cheaper than buying the fuel.
The Golf was totaled.
They'll pop it back on and fix the scratch later.
They snap together like a kid's toy.
So you got rid of the body shop.
The plant also gets smaller.
We could, of course, buy more efficiency.
Or wait to capture the second half of it.
So we have lots of options.
You're not paid to change size class.
And Detroit will make money on every unit.
So this is a huge social win, too.
Then there's an important military role.
The same for the modern semi-conductor industry.
But here's how the whole thing fits together.
We could rerun that play a lot better now.
Ours is on the demand side.
We are the Saudi Arabia of "nega-barrels."

Lee Hotz: Inside an Antarctic time machine
Nowhere on Earth offers us such a perfect record.
They have to dig themselves out every day.
It makes for an exotic and chilly commute.
It's really a time machine.
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.
Each cylinder is a parfait of time.
And this is the object of their scrutiny.
Why do we need to study this anymore?
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.
This process requires extraordinary precautions.
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.
Here, the ice seems a living presence.
The wind that rubs against it gives it voice.
It is a voice of experience.
It is a voice we should heed.
Brenda Laurel on games for girls
It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.
These people aren't that smart.
There's six billion dollars on the table.
So, what is the deal here?
Then we formed a spin-off company.
Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.
Hers is more into boys.
Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe.
Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one.
But she gives my sister everything.
Let's hope it's really stable.
This is the second day in Rockett's life.
Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere!
Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on?
She asked me to make sure you knew about it.
Miko: I don't think so.
Rockett: Really? What other party?
He's invited all the best people.
Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list.
BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.
If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.
Oops, I turned the wrong way.
But you get the general idea of the product.
It turns out they're really great.
Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know?

Paul Bloom: The origins of pleasure
This is Hermann Goering.
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.
And it was his favorite artwork ever.
But he didn't confess to treason.
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."
Now nobody believed him.
And he said, "I'll prove it.
So they brought him in.
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.
And then the charges of treason were dropped.
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.
And he killed himself soon afterwards.
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.
It was not that painting, but that painting.
Would you eat this?
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat or a human.
That's not so surprising.
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?
If you like somebody, they look better to you.
This was recorded in 1931.
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.
As a third example, consider consumer products.
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.
So one answer was George Clooney.
That causes a huge drop in the value.
So let's go back to art.
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?
They just don't like it.
This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.
And here's a brief clip of this.
Not bad. It's also not good.
So she's struck with pity.
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.
And people have different views on this.
So it was a series of five painful shocks.
The first shock is recorded as very painful.
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.
The pain gets less.
The first shock hurts like hell.
And I'll end with that. Thank you.
Ben Goldacre: Battling bad science
And nobody really knows what epidemiology is.
And these are just some of the examples.
So already you can see there are contradictions.
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer.
That's what happens in academic journals.
That's what happens at academic conferences.
And nobody minds that. We actively welcome it.
It's like a consenting intellectual S&M activity.
Again, every country has somebody like this.
She is our TV diet guru.
from somewhere in America.
You get a certificate and everything.
Next, we need proper science, proper evidence.
So, "Red wine can help prevent breast cancer."
So what we want is studies in real human people.
And here's another example.
So ideally what you want to do is a trial.
And this is the trial of fish oil pills.
And they said, "We've done a trial.
That should always ring alarm bells.
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design?
So there's no control; there's no control group.
But that sounds really techie.
That's a technical term.
They got older. We all develop over time.
And of course, also there's the placebo effect.
It's about our beliefs and expectations.
It's about the cultural meaning of a treatment.
Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day.
But that's not enough.
But actually in a lot of situations that's wrong.
How can we explain this strange phenomenon?
It's at the top of the pyramid of evidence.
You can use statistics, or you can use stories.
This is something called funnel plot.
So they all cluster together.
The big trials are closer to the true answer.
Well they're heinous, they really are.
This is a drug called reboxetine.
And I'm a very nerdy doctor.
And this is not an isolated story.
Alex Tabarrok on how ideas trump crises
Trade walls began to come tumbling down.
We globalized the world. And what does that mean?
Transportation walls came tumbling down.
Trade has increased.
Here is just a little bit of data.
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.
Incomes at that time less than $1,000 per year.
And over the next 18 years have almost tripled.
Growth was negative.
Now ideas have this amazing property.
This is practically the model of TED.
And to explain why this is so, I have a question.
The reason for this is incentives.
In this case misery truly does love company.
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.
One idea, one world, one market.
Well how else can we create new ideas?
How else can we create new ideas?
Well, more idea creators.
The United States has been an idea leader.
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.
And for that I am very grateful.
That is a good thing.
Now we're not there yet.
But it is going to happen in this century.
But in this century China is coming on line.
India is coming on line.
Africa is coming on line.
Here is just some data. This is China.
Now think what this means.
1900s: maybe one percent.
Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.
That's not that far.
But some of our grandchildren probably will.
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.
Alright what about problems?
What about a great depression?
Here is GDP per capita from 1900 to 1929.
What would you have predicted, not knowing this?
So what actually happened?
We went off a cliff but we recovered.
Alright. What else?
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.
You can see this in the data.
As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.
Now remember here what Jefferson said.
But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?
So my view is: Be optimistic.
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.
Sam Richards: A radical experiment in empathy
My students often ask me, "What is sociology?"
And they say, "So how can I be a sociologist?
How can I understand those invisible forces?"
And I say, "Empathy.
Start with empathy.
It all begins with empathy.
Here, I'll give you an example.
And they got fabulously wealthy in doing so.
And then I asked myself the question.
Does this sound familiar?
And back in China, what do they say in China?
You can't expect that."
And we fight back, and it gets really ugly.
And the Chinese respond in a very ugly way.
And just imagine what you would feel.
If you can, that's empathy -- that's empathy.
You've left your shoes, and you've stood in mine.
And you've got to feel that.
Okay, so that's the warm up.
That's the warm up.
You want your kids to have a better life.
That's what you want.
You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.
You want a better life for yourself.
So here, let me help you.
It's your resource; it's not somebody else's.
It's your land; it's your resource.
Somebody else has a design for it.
And you know why they have a design?
You know why they have their eyes set on it?
And what else do you think about these people?
The Americans, they're rich.
And back home, what do you see?
Poverty, despair, struggle.
Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.
This is what you see.
You see people struggling to get by.
I mean, it's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.
And you feel something about this.
And you feel it; you see it every day.
It's part of your life.
And you talk about it with your friends.
You can't help but think that.
It's in the forefront of your mind always.
You say, "How is that possible?"
But there's something else.
And what do you see? They're Christians.
They're Christians.
And they do wonderful things.
You read about it, you hear about it.
Your God's an idol; his God is the true God.
They don't know anything about him, but you do.
You pass it around. You pass his words around.
I mean this is serious. You're afraid.
Whatever. I don't know."
You know what it means.
It's a holy war against Muslims.
Look, invade, subdue them, take their resources.
If they won't submit, kill them.
That's what this is about.
This is frightening.
And the Americans: "Ah, he's a knucklehead.
They laugh him off. You don't laugh him off.
"He wants to burn Korans, our holy book.
These Christians, who are these Christians?
Of course you're going to think this.
You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.
These Christians are nuts.
And go to the website.
It says "U.S. Army" right on it.
And you're reading this website.
You don't know that.
For you, this is like all Christians.
It's all over the Web, Bible Boot Camp.
Isn't that interesting.
And it scares you, and it frightens you.
So these guys, you see them.
They're my students, my friends.
I know what they're thinking: "You don't know."
That's what they are to you.
Of course, you got it wrong.
You're generalizing. It's wrong.
You don't understand the Americans.
It's not a Christian invasion.
You have it wrong. You've missed it.
Of course you don't. Very few people do.
But some of you do.
And this is a perspective.
Okay, so now, here's what we're going to do.
So everyone's back in the room, okay.
Now here comes the radical experiment.
So we're all back home.
This photo: this woman, man, I feel her.
She's my sister, my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.
She's anybody to me.
So here's what I want you to do.
Let's go back to my first example of the Chinese.
So I want you to go there.
What do you think about that scene?
Okay, try this. Bring it back.
This is the scene here.
These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.
And maybe they succeeded. Maybe they succeeded.
Can you feel the rage?
It shouldn't be that difficult.
You just -- oh, man.
Now, put yourself in their shoes.
Are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders?
I'm going out to defend your freedom, your lives.
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine saying that?
What do you think they're feeling?
You see, that's empathy.
It's also understanding.
Why would you use this example of all examples?"
And I say, because ... because.
You're allowed to hate these people.
Whatever it is, you can go so far.
And they build a big, complex world.
Everything has changed.
Everything in your life has changed.
And that's, of course, what this is about.
Attend to other lives, other visions.
Listen to other people, enlighten ourselves.
And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do too.
E.O. Wilson on saving life on Earth
And within a few months.
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.
So the question is: what are they all doing?
The fact is, we don't know.
Our lives depend upon these creatures.
And I'd like to show it.
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday.
And that may be just the beginning!
And so it is everywhere one looks.
That's in the United States.
We urgently need to change this.
And we need that knowledge.
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."
Amateurs can do it also.
Technology has moved forward.
I wish you would help them.
Working together, we can make this real.
That is my wish. Thank you.
architecture,design,sound
It's time to start designing for our ears.
We're designing environments that make us crazy.
How does this work? Well, two ways.
There's a second way though, as well.
Spaces tend to include noise and acoustics.
Many rooms are not so good.
Hospital sound is getting worse all the time.
Sleep is absolutely crucial for recovery.
This is an area I intend to take on this year.
I am forced to ask myself a question.
The children couldn't hear their teachers.
Old-fashioned classrooms suffer too.
Not so good, is it?
Julian Treasure: What a difference.
That is not good for you.
To you and me, that's a heart attack.
Two and a half thousand pounds.
I think the economics are pretty clear on this.
I'm glad that debate is happening on this.
We have urban planners.
Where are the urban sound planners?
Where are the office sound planners?
Where are the interior sound designers?
I love that phrase.
culture,language,psychology,science
Steven Pinker on language and thought
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
For example, the dative construction in English.
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.
This would be an example of how to do that.
How are these construals reflected in language?
Only humans can possess things.
So why should anyone care?
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"
So what's going on?
Now, relationship types can be negotiated.
Well, what does this have to do with language?
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.
So this is a rather fraught situation.
So you get the best of both worlds.
Please raise your hand -- oh, that's a lot.
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.
And I spent about three years researching.
In total, they weigh 103.7 kilograms.
You probably start the day with a shower.
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.
And what it is -- it's actually steak.
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.
And can you send me a bullet?"
It's really a sort of magical moment.
In total, I found 185 products.
Janine Benyus shares nature's designs
Did you notice this section is foreplay?
Now that is foreplay.
And so they still weren't getting it.
And they said, calcium carbonate.
And they didn't know that.
Why don't they just keep on going?
We're done. You know, I've seen that island.
That's the profound switch.
3.8 billion years of field-testing.
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.
What's the syllabus?
Three questions, for me, are key.
How does life make things?
This is the opposite; this is how we make things.
How does life make the most of things?
That's a geranium pollen.
Life adds information to matter.
In other words: structure.
Really quick syllabus.
The two groups are not talking to each other.
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly.
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.
This is Sandia National Labs.
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work.
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses.
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.
Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.
Solar transformations: the most exciting one.
See that up-close picture?
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.
Here are two organisms that pull water.
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?
Green chemistry is chemistry in water.
We do chemistry in organic solvents.
And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.
Healing: this is a good one.
That little guy over there is a tardigrade.
They can be put in a glove compartment, OK.
I'm not going to get to 12.
That's the biggest design challenge.
Good luck having a conversation with them.
Janine Benyus: Oh really?
OK, so that's the healing one.
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.
This is a huge and important one, number 11.
And that's the growing fertility.
That means, you know, net fertility farming.
Our farming has done the opposite.
That's the twelfth one.
CA: Janine, thank you so much.
entrepreneur,global issues,poverty,women
You can't count what you don't see.
And we don't invest in what's invisible to us.
But this is the face of resilience.
And that turned out to be women.
Why are you so passionate?"
And that's really how I became an entrepreneur."
So maybe you could interview her."
And she was just the start.
But think about this.
Most people say women.
And in many places, they're there.
She sells chocolates.
And that's just to start.
I think that is terrific.
We have so much room to grow.
"You will find a job. Take the leap."
The women in my family are not exceptions.
The women in this room and watching in L.A.
and all around the world are not exceptions.
We are not a special interest group.
We are the majority.
And it is time for all of us to think bigger.
Joe Sabia: The technology of storytelling
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.
I would love to share with you a story.
But it was a little bit boring.
His name was Lothar, Lothar Meggendorfer.
He grabbed his pen, he snatched his scissors.
And this was a cause for celebration.
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

Catherine Mohr builds green
First of all, I'm a geek.
And so I have to figure this out for myself.
For example: Is this evil?
But can I use a paper towel?
Wipe it up, throw it away.
This is now operating energy.
Well, now a paper towel looks better.
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
And now all bets are off.
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
We wanted to know how much better we could do.
So first, we demolish it.
We then put in framing.
And yet, all the press is focused on that.
Except for flooring.
So what does this mean?
But my elephant in the living room flies.
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.
Joshua Klein on the intelligence of crows
Any of you get really freaked out by that?
You might want to leave now.
So, this is a vending machine for crows.
We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.
And he said that was impossible.
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.
And so I built the vending machine.
We're seeing a population boom with crows.
So that's no great surprise.
And I'll give you an example of that.
So this is Betty. She's a New Caledonian crow.
But the researchers had a problem.
You see, it wasn't working very well.
But she did it all on her own.
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.
That's the part where the researchers freak out.
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
And the next month. And after summer break.
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.
It's fairly interesting.
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.
Joshua Klein: Yeah, yeah. Pretty interesting.
In fact, that's old hat for crows.
Parents seem to be teaching their young.
So we know that there's lots of crows.
So that's what we did.
This is a vending machine for crows.
It's pretty simple.
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.
And so this goes on for some time.
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.
They figure it's gotta have more to it.
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.
And then, we're off to the races.
Or maybe do search and rescue?
Anna Deavere Smith: Four American characters
You see, we also have the technology.
I say, less and less the human touch.
Now we have humans imitating robots.
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
And so suddenly they're looking at me.
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
And that's Studs Terkel.
So this piece is about a negative imagination.
Everything I do is word for word off a tape.
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
And it didn't work, didn't work.
I didn't even go and see what was happening.
I just sat there and listened.
And then he put her in the hallway.
And then he told her, get up.
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.
"The next morning she was dead.
My own child, I let that happen to."
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
They did not, so there were riots.
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
"I used to believe America was the best.
I never saw any poor man, any black.
Why? Why do we have to be left out?
But after the riot, it's too much difference.
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
It's still there; it can burst out anytime."
Mrs. Young-Soon Han.
Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.
And this is called "Toughness."
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
I think that's good luck.
"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.
She said, 'Look who she is.
"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.
"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.
Rives remixes TED2006
Mockingbirds are badass.
They listen and mimic and remix what they like.
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.
I'll get your postman making dinner plans.
I'll get the last time you lied.
I'll get everyone's good mornings.
I don't care how you make 'em.
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.
What does a violin have to do with technology?
Where in the world is this world heading?
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.
There's about 10 million phage per job.
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.
Everybody gets heard.
Wait for the man with the mockingbird."
Chris Anderson: Wow.
Let me connect the dots.
It's old-school demographics.
It's really just been basic demographics.
They can make some educated guesses.
It had been presumed before.
This is far too simplistic.
Why should I know this?
Can you even imagine what that looks like?
I can't wait to find out what it looks like.

Genital stimulation. Duh.
And she went to a neurologist who was fascinated.
No. It was the whole, you know, motion.
She was part of a study at Rutgers University.
You gotta love that. Rutgers.
And I said, "So, could you do it right here?"
It was remarkable. It took about one minute.
There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.
It's like this. You trigger the spot.
The dead guy, or gal, goes ... like that.
But it would be an orgasm -- nonetheless.
I said to her, "You should do an experiment.
I said, "You should actually do this."
Very heavy hetero guy.
He tried everything his friends suggested.
Nothing seemed to help.
And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.
Married, single, unattached hiccupper.
It was called the "upsuck" theory.
They didn't buy it.
And they masturbated.
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.
I have an answer for you. I have two answers.
This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."
This one involves men.
Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory.
So now you have an evolutionary excuse.
And I got a copy of this DVD.
It all looks very innocent.
This is to mimic the weight of the boar.
And the happy result.
Why don't you have the farmers do that?
That's not one of your five steps."
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.
They developed an artificial coition machine.
This is basically a penis camera on a motor.
And the woman would have sex with it.
That is what they would do. Pretty amazing.
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.
This was not idle curiosity.
Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
Sadly, he's anonymous. His name is not mentioned.

Remarkably -- no, miraculously -- he lived.

It gets way better.

Terry Moore: How to tie your shoes
And I think that's true.
Now I know that seems ludicrous.
I know that seems ludicrous.
But not so -- let me demonstrate.
Now as it turns out -- thank you.
Wait, there's more.
And here's how to tell.
That's the weak form of the knot.
We're going to do this one more time.
Start as usual, go the other way around the loop.
There it is: the strong form of the shoe knot.
Live long and prosper.
David Hanson: Robots that "show emotion"
There he's starting to walk.
I built the head. They built the body.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
And this is really heavily backlit.
Okay, so you smile, frowning.
Those machines have no place for empathy.
So, we're involving two things.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.

Sebastian Wernicke: 1000 TEDTalks, 6 words
I think we have a situation here.
And I did a little calculation of this.
Here's my approach to it all.
Isn't there something shorter?
The only question is, how short can you get?
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."
I actually like that one.
We could have been done by lunch here.
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.
He always proves us wrong.
They just had some general comment.
There were others, and I found this quite cheeky.
I don't know any TEDTalk that contains this.
Here are some of my favorites.
Again, there were some misunderstandings.
I mean that's the essence of it all.
So I had 50 overall summaries done.
Peter Molyneux demos Milo, the virtual boy
Now, this tech incorporates three big elements.
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.
Now, you notice he's sitting.
So let's move forward.
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.
So here he is walking through the grass.
And you're able to interact with his world.
That means no two people's Milos can be the same.
You're actually sculpting a human being here.
So, he's discovering the garden.
Very simple at the start.
His face, by the way, is fully AI-driven.
We actually do something called body matching.
Now we've used the hand.
The other thing to use is your body.
Milo: I could just squish it.
Do you want Milo to squash it?
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.
Now look at his response.
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."
We've got a database of words which we recognize.
We pick those words out.
And we'll do that in a second.
Milo: I wonder how deep it is.
We're actually teaching him.
Okay, this is skimming stones.
How do you skim stones?
You stand up, and you skim the stone.
Try hitting the boat.
Milo: Ahhh. So close.
PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.
And we're going to help him with this now.
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.
It's all been too much for him.
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.
They're always getting stressed.
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?
We don't know anyone.
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.
Milo: It was good skimming stones.
You cleaned up my room.
His mind is based in a cloud.
Thank you very much indeed.
brain,neuroscience,science,technology
We are always chasing storms.
We are doing a thousand now.
You can put it louder if you can.
And that's exactly what we did 10 years ago.
And Aurora liked to play video games.
Actually any primate will do that.
And to our shock, that's exactly what Aurora did.
She played the game without moving her body.
Well, we did that 10 years ago.
Just fast forward 10 years.
And that's exactly what they do.
How far can we take it?
So where are we taking all this?
Mark Pagel: How language transformed humanity
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.
How do we know this?
You can follow it through the fossil record.
But by comparison, we can learn.
We can benefit from others' ideas.
We can build on their wisdom.
Social learning really is visual theft.
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.
Now the job is done.
Language really is the voice of our genes.
Now you might say, well, this is just natural.
And he said to me, "Oh no.
They're far closer together than that."
They slow the flow of technologies.
And they even slow the flow of genes.
This remarkable image is not a map of the world.
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.
One of them always drives the other extinct.
Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.
My car has an engine, but it's not a Ferrari.
MR: Thank you very much indeed.
Sheryl WuDunn: Our century's greatest injustice
So, let's start off in China.
This photo was taken two weeks ago.
But this is Tiananmen Square.
Let me take you to the real China.
Why would we waste this money on you?"
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.
We wrote about her in The New York Times.
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.
She went to high school.
She went to vocational school for accounting.
She sent money back to her family.
What we saw was a natural experiment.
The village became a real standout.
In the 19th century, it was slavery.
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
She's exaggerating."
Well, let me ask you this question.
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
And, you know, it happens for several reasons.
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.
The entire center was filled with girls like her.
Poverty, for instance.
There are three reasons why this is the case.
The second reason is it has to do with spending.
You need to use scarce resources.
Do you think we'll make it?"
So here is Bill of Arabia.
And I'll just say two things about this.
Let me tell you about Mahabuba.
She lives in Ethiopia.
She was married against her will at age 13.
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
In a word, she stank.
That night, there was a stick in the hut.
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.
Let me tell you about Saima.
And at the time, she was miserable.
Saima's not going to produce you a son."
This is when she had her second daughter.
So now they're in it together.
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.
The twins started producing milk.
They sold the milk for cash.
She rocketed to the top of her class.
And that goat was $120.
But I want to give you a reality check.
There's Bill Easterly's book.
There's a book called "Dead Aid."
You know, the criticism is fair; it isn't easy.
He sort of mumbled.
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.
So then, I ask, what's in it for you?
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?
I will just leave you with two things.
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur.
She never broke down.
What that was was a bird feeder.
So, here's the cause.
Feel happier and help save the world.
David Keith's unusual climate change idea
The fact is -- uh-uh.
And we've accomplished close to zip.
This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.
But in fact, they're growing faster.
I don't want to depress you too much.
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.
Instead, we spend our time talking.
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.
They will completely lose.
And there's no adaption.
So this problem is absolutely soluble.
And I know for certain that that will work.
And the reason is, it's been done.
The result of that was pretty dramatic.
There's no big mystery about it.
But it clearly cools down.
And one other thing: it's fast.
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
But if you do this, it's quick.
And the answer seems to be yes.
This topic is also old.
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.
We should, but it made exactly this point.
So, in a sense, there's not much new.
The one new thing is this essay.
He said roughly what's been said before.
I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.
And so you see a net force away from the sun.
That's called the photophoretic force.
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.
And the box has two knobs.
We have no global governance.
But we're building that box.
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.
We need a broader debate.
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
It's not a good idea, but it's just important.
And that calculation isn't much in dispute.
I don't think anybody takes that seriously.
But here's a case which is harder to reject.
That's an absolutely possible scenario.
But there is a problem with that view.
This is what economists call a moral hazard.
Should we do serious research on this topic?
A very small amount of money would get us some.
But I have a lot of reservations.
Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.
A treaty that decides who gets to do this.

Taryn Simon photographs secret sites
Photography threatens fantasy.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
So I create these two poles.
This process costs 60,000 dollars.
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.
I do take certain liberties and intervene.
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.
And Playboy is always in the top few.
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.
It's a very violent process that is little known.
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.
This is the Death Star.
And it's shown here in its true orientation.
They flip the negative.
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.
It's called the World Church of God.
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.
And I put them into my photograph.
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
It's titled "The Innocents."
I'll give you an example from a case.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.
That's it. Thank you.
beauty,culture,happiness
Well, we certainly try.
There is a rash of suicide in China.
But this does not follow any of the usual trends.
And that's how powerful the one negative is.
I also put in here the stress response.
But unfortunately, we need this system in part.
We really have two command posts.
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.
People have also wanted to deconstruct.
We don't seem to have a word for that.
We're also born pleasure-seekers.
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.
And we see here the smile.
Extroverts use it more than introverts.
Our pleasures are really ancient.
Here is a three-week-old baby.
We are social beings from the beginning.
It's sort of "me," not "we."
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.
There is a profound need to belong.
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.
And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.
But it's not irrelevant.
So clearly there is some effect.
But the effect is relatively small.
So we have here, this couple.
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.
I end with a few quotes.
"First, say to yourself what you would be.
Then do what you have to do."
Africa,animals,technology,war
As a child, I had two passions.
One was a passion for rodents.
I also had a passion for Africa.
Africa was truly fascinating for me.
Why would you choose rats?
Because, aren't they vermin?
And actually, our product -- what you see here.
There's a target somewhere here.
There, the animal finds a mine.
It scratches on the soil.
And the animal comes back for a food reward.
Very sustainable in this environment.
Here, the animal gets its food reward.
And that's how it works.
Now why would you use rats?
They're extremely sensitive to smell.
Now how do we communicate with rats?
This consists of 400 square meters.
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
But let me bring you to a very different problem.
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
Here it's already at the third sample.
This is a positive sample.
But let's stick first to tuberculosis.
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
So this is really considerable.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
So, to standardize this.
This is in a prototype stage.
We don't have a working system here yet.
Just think about this problem for a second.
We're looking at neurons here.
So, how do you go about studying the brain?
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.
And this is truly astonishing.
Well, why is that important?
Well, let's take a look at the next slide.
Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.
All of that happened relatively quickly.
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.
So, here you have my last slide.

Jonathan Drori: Every pollen grain has a story
Thank you. I have two missions here today.
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.
This is amazing, I think.
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.
Cool pollen, though.
This one I particularly like.
The pollen has little barbs on it, if we look.
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.
This is a horse chestnut.
health,medical research,medicine,science,women
So this is the leading killer of women.
Because the personal, as you know, is political.
And not enough is being done about this.
Since 1984, more women die in the U.S. than men.
So it's a woman's disease now.
So that was a big wake-up call in the 1980's.
I'm going to tell you why.
Heart disease kills people, often very quickly.
Breast cancer, mortality is down to four percent.
And then physicians have gone to bat.
We've done the research.
We have effective therapies now.
Women are living longer than ever.
It's not happening, and it's time.
And she wanted to study the Talmud.
And so how did she get educated then?
She had to impersonate a man.
She had to look like a man.
Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy, was a cardiologist.
Mortality is not going down, it's going up.
And here's what the story is.
And they're just passed.
And it funds a lot of my research.
It funds research all over the place.
It told us about hormone replacement therapy.
It's informed us about osteoporosis.
And the under-reading was women aren't worth it.
She was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."
And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.
Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.
Horrible chest pain.
There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.
That's a man heart attack.
So what do you think happens to these gals?
They're often not recognized, sent home.
I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there.
Where do women get fat?
Cellulite here, cellulite here.
Men just have to dump it in a single area."
So we said, "Let's look at these."
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.
Panel B is the woman, very smooth.
She's just laid it down nice and tidy.
Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.
So that was a discovery.
Now what are the implications of that?
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
We selected this for the research.
And that is microvascular obstruction.
So we're very excited about M.R.
These are our life-saving treatments.
And those little red boxes are deaths.
So those are the consequences.
Why are there women and men?
Because women bring new life into the world.
That's all stem cells.
These are female and male stem cells.
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.
Okay, so here's where we started.
We are bending the curve.
We're bending the curve.
Now are we happy with this?
We've worked on this for 15 years.
So we're 35 years behind.
And in fact, it probably won't.
But we cannot stop now.
Too many lives are at stake.
So what do we need to do?
And women do fundraising.
And it's political.
So we have these feast and famine cycles.
So thank you for your attention.

Nina Tandon: Caring for engineered tissue
Good morning everybody.
What does that even mean?
What makes the heart unique?
What else do we know about the heart?
Well, heart cells are pretty greedy.
Let's take the example of electrical stimulation.
It's about the size of a mini marshmallow.
And after one week, it's beating.
You can see it in the upper left-hand corner.
But don't worry if you can't see it so well.
It's amazing that these cells beat at all.
What does this mean for us?
Let's do something really simple.
Deb Roy: The birth of a word
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.
DR: He sure nailed it, didn't he.
So he didn't just learn water.
He was an early talker.
And so we started to analyze why.
Why were certain words born before others?
And the [horizontal] axis is time.
But that's looking at the speech context.
What about the visual context?
So welcome to my home.
That's me and my son on the floor.
The spiral thread we call a "solo hot spot."
So here's how we're approaching this.
In this video, again, my son is being traced out.
He's leaving red ink behind.
And there's our nanny by the door.
Nanny: You want water?
We call these wordscapes.
We can take the word "bye" as in "good bye."
And so our effort took an unexpected turn.
And the same idea now can be built up.
And then the important third dimension.
And there are fascinating dynamics at play.
They talk to other people.
We've given this person a name.
And he was quiet for a moment.
And I thought, "What am I thinking?
And I thought, "Wow, this is powerful stuff."
It's a cluttered environment; it's natural life.
Listen very carefully.
DR: Ma, he's walking.
Tom Wujec on 3 ways the brain creates meaning
And the consensus was: it really worked.
This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?"
The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.
We're only going to talk about three of them.
So the first one is called the ventral stream.
It's on this side of the brain.
It's the "what" detector.
And it's the part that feels.
It's the selective logic.
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
It activates a different part of the brain.
So the point of this is what?
The lessons for us are three-fold.
So the low-tech version looks like this.
This is a time-lapse view of it.
You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?"
You'll be able to figure that out.
No Powerpoint is used in two days.
And this is our great unveiling for today.
So making images meaningful has three components.
Secondly, making them interactive.
And then thirdly, making them persistent.
architecture,creativity,design,green,technology
It was all just gone.
This is the first house I built.
Have a little turret there.
And then these buttons on the corbels here.
Right there -- those are hickory nuts.
Then, this is a look at the inside.
Even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.
Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.
This is going up into the turret.
If not, it goes into the toilet.
It's a two-person tub.
Then, this is a house based on a Budweiser can.
That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.
And then the faucet, there, is a beer tap.
It's a pretty panel of glass.
So don't put it there.
Then, another bathroom upstairs.
Don't put it in the foyer.
What does that mean?
Oh, that's a cell phone.
But you've never seen this one before.
That's not a cell phone.
That's one of those new chocolate cell phones."
That's how we process information.
Because that's what you do with a cracked pane.
We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice."
So, that serves me every day.
Repetition creates pattern.
It doesn't make any difference.
Predicated on plumb level, square and centered.
That's the difference.
I feature organic process.
Dead-center John Dewey.
Apollonian mindset creates mountains of waste.
"Oops, scratch, dumpster."
So now we have standardized materials.
We create mountains of waste.
Well, that's just a myth.
"Dan, I just don't think I'm ready."
"Jim, now it's time. You're the down, oh."
And that's what happened there.
The problem is we can't afford it.
Now there's a blight on the planet.
Wired with 14-gauge wire typically.
Are we just being numbingly stupid?
The walls are this thick.
The whole thing has the structural value of corn.
"No, no. We had a wind last night.
Then when they degrade, what do you do with them?
We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.
My oh my, that makes it worse.
And we get sucked into that faster than anything.
It's a pretty quick read.
In there he talked about the divided self.
That happens in the building industry as well.
That's why all of our subdivisions look the same.
I'll bet all your shoes match.
Sometimes those guys are Nazis, my oh my.
That exacerbates and continues this model.
The last thing is gregariousness.
Human beings are a social species.
Human beings are like that.
And so you see this in junior high a lot.
See, look, don't touch my designer jeans.
I see you don't have designer jeans.
You're not one of the beautiful people.
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms.
Second, security. Third, relationships.
Fourth, status, self-esteem -- that is, vanity.
And we're taking vanity and shoving it down here.
That is, our housing has become a commodity.
If failure destroys you, then you can't do this.
What do you think, honey?"
If it doesn't work, take it down.
This country over here is China. This is India.
Or have they got longer lives and live up there?
This is India. Indonesia's moving on pretty fast.
One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day.
We heard it in other forms. And who are these?
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
And Sheikh Sayed did that in a fairly good way.
The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there.
Because the data is hidden down in the databases.
You can take a data set and put it there.
But this is what we would like to see, isn't it?
The publicly-funded data is down here.
And we would like flowers to grow out on the Net.
He only says, "We can't do it."
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
This is the income distribution of China, 1970.
Almost like a ghost, isn't it, huh?
But this is hypothesis-generating.
James Watson on how he discovered DNA
But it slightly bores me.
In back of me is a picture of me when I was 17.
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.
I guess, you know, he was the big hero.
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
You can read it in about two hours.
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.
Most people believed it was proteins.
And there I met Francis Crick.
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
So we built a three-stranded model.
The people from London came up.
They said it was lousy, and it was.
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.
If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.
But there was ones in the literature.
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
And so Bragg said, "Build models."
Well, of course, I wanted to build models.
She was a crystallographer.
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
We weren't the best chemists in the room.
I just put them down like they were in the books.
He said they were wrong.
And we knew we were right.
From nothing to thing.
So we saw how genetic information is carried.
It's the order of the four bases.
And you copy it by going from strand-separating.
But that's not the way most scientists think.
Most scientists are really rather dull.
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.
RNA provides the information for protein.
Well, at that time -- I should go back.
And we use their technique.
So the first disease he looked at is autism.
And you can see here, there are a lot of them.
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.
It's a wonderful way to find genes.
And yet, in the controls there were three.
So what's the meaning of the controls?
Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?
So it's, to me, an extraordinarily exciting time.
consciousness,medicine,technology
Simon Lewis: Don't take consciousness for granted
Everywhere I went, I felt at home.
This is where it began.
This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.
This is a police photo. That's actually my car.
Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.
It's so unpredictable and so fragile.
And this is how we began.
We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.
These are just some examples.
That statistic is so sad.
But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.
I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.
But let's take a look behind my eyes.
The first C is cognitive training.
Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.
And you can see here there are three columns.
Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.
That's when I was discharged from the system.
What does average I.Q. really mean?
Then I underwent cognitive training.
This is not supposed to occur.
And this person is particularly interesting.
The craniomandibular system is critical to that.
This affected my entire body.
That tiny misalignment.
Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.
I still had migraine headaches.
That's basically it.
This is an MRI MRA MRV, a volumetric MRI.
Communication, the next C. This is critical.
All consciousness is about communication.
This is it being held in the hand.
It weighs less than a gram.
Where does it go inside the body?
So it goes in and it stays there.
Here are the implantation sites.
The main unit will then go inside the brain.
I don't have the ability to control my left foot.
I believe that we can all rise and shine.
I don't know what I had in my mind.
And he was walking around.
And we have his book outside in the bookshop.
And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.
And it works. It works.
And this, this is the implantable generation.
I should clarify that.
The audience is too small.
So he saw a need and he stepped in.
He's a very, very remarkable man.
He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science.

Drew Curtis: How I beat a patent troll
So case closed, right?
And this can take quite a while.
And they started settling out.
"And we'd like to go ahead and close this out.
My response: "How about nothing?!"
We didn't have high hopes for that outcome.
Now how did that happen?
It came back signed.
Now why? You can call them.
They're not under NDA either.
Patents are very difficult to overturn.
Infringement is a lot easier to disprove.
So what does all this mean?
And what do they do with that money?
And I thought, "I should patent this."
My daddy, he calls me all the time."
"Lucky for you he calls at all," said Jasmine.
"I haven't heard from my dad in years."
The wisdom lives inside of them.
They were dressed to the nines.
They really enjoyed each other's company.
It was a huge success.
And the girls decided to make it an annual event.
"Why not?" the girls asked.
"Because he's in jail," she bravely admitted.
"And come in shackles?
That's worse than not having him here at all."
Because that's what they called them.
So, 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited.
They laughed together.
Even the guards cried.
I have had my father in my life always.
He's even here today.

Bruce Aylward: How we'll stop polio for good
Actually, it's a really big idea.
This is a polio vaccine.
This is a great technology.
We can take it completely for granted.
But it wasn't always that way.
People were terrified of this disease.
And it was because of scenes like this.
In this scene, people are living in an iron lung.
This disease was terrifying.
There was no cure, and there was no vaccine.
But this wasn't the case everywhere in the world.
But the reality is that polio still exists today.
This is the picture.
There's not very much left in the world.
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.
They had come from thousands of miles away.
But the message was very clear.
Polio is still a devastating, explosive disease.
It's just happening in another part of the world.
We're not trying to control polio.
This virus can only survive in people.
It can't live for a very long time in people.
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.
So it was a massive effort.
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.
With polio it's almost completely different.
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.
It's just two drops, like that.
They're right at the center of the whole thing.
Last year, it was 1,000.
We should abandon this idea of eradication.
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."
There's absolutely no question.
These are children like Umar.
Umar also has polio.
Umar was paralyzed for life.
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004.
We think children deserve better.
And we didn't start with the easy places.
And yet, the impossible is happening.
India's not unique.
Now we're in tough times economically.
Here's a great idea to spread: End polio now.
Help us tell the story.
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?
It keeps getting reinfected.
They're going to be the tough ones.
BG: Now what about the money?
And is it easy to raise that money?
BA: It's interesting.
But right now we don't have enough of that.
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.
So good luck. We're all in this with you.
And here's a prime example.
Well, we needn't have worried.
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
But that's not always easy for us.
Sleep deprivation is extreme.
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.
And I do believe you should stay with us.
And you can see the start of it here.
Now back to the leopard.
These are precious to us, these divides.
So we knew we had to react quickly.
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.
We felt like we were surrogate parents.
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.
They ended up sleeping for hours.
It's simply not sustainable.
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.
I call it complacency -- our complacency.
They're essential to the habitat.
If they disappear, all of that goes away.
That is the situation we're in -- the last lions.
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.
And that's Richard Feynman.
It's just elementary probability theory.
"Queerer than we can suppose."
He stood up, and moved out from behind his desk.
He quickened his pace, almost to a jog now.
What is the wall mostly made of? Atoms.
All I have to do is merge the spaces.
A small insect would reverse these priorities.
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily.
How else would you remember it?
But here is the bombshell: You weren't there.

Evan Grant: Making sound visible through cymatics
He actually coined the term cymatics.
As you can see with your own eyes.
So, what excites me about cymatics?
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.
And there is thousands of these.
So what does this all mean?
Cymatics is accessible to everybody.
We can inspire each other.
James Nachtwey fights XDR-TB
Rory Stewart: Why democracy matters
And this isn't just a problem in Britain.
Since then, what's happened?
Why should we get away from those arguments?
The point about democracy is not instrumental.
It's not about the things that it brings.
The point about democracy is intrinsic.
Democracy is not simply a question of structures.
It is a state of mind. It is an activity.
And part of that activity is honesty.
It's a question of what the citizens do.
http://www.ted.com/talks/ethan_zuckerman.html
Ethan Zuckerman: Listening to global voices
It's been a major trending topic.
And it's terribly endangered.
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."
There's more than five million of them.
Twitter recently did some research.
They looked at their local population.
But generally speaking, most of us don't.
And we tend not to see that wider picture.
He's at a technology conference in Florida.
And Negroponte says this is crazy.
This is the old economy.
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.
And it's going to change the world as we know it.
He's totally wrong about this one.
There's crackdowns on the press.
Here's what I think is going on.
It includes things like the Internet cables.
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.
It's all right there.
It's extremely lumpy.
The world is, in fact, getting more global.
It's getting more connected.
More of problems are global in scale.
More of our economics is global in scale.
And our media is less global by the day.
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.
And that's basically what our media is about.
You probably won't.
We look at the internet.
This is a problem we have to solve.
So here's the good news.
This is a group called Global Voices.
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.
Our mission was to fix the world's media.
We started in 2004.
They were doing something much simpler.
Most independent media was shut down.
And the results can be pretty funny.
And if you think this is absurd, it's not.
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.
They put it online for free.
We use a lot of search.
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.
Basically, she's a deejay.
I can ask her what to read.
He goes by the moniker White African.
He is a bridge figure.
Dhani has a television show.
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
He finds a local sporting team.
My challenge instead is this.
We have to fix our media.
We have to fix our immigration policy.
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.
Sherwin Nuland on electroshock therapy
Last time, I talked about death and dying.
But it wasn't enough to use the priests.
Someone who is, as the Italians say, "cagoots."
That's not going to do anything terrible to him."
So people would have a real grand mal seizure.
And let me tell you this story.
I was a little prone to depression.
I couldn't even pull the covers off myself.
Well, you know what bovine stercus is?
That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.
So I was one of their failures.
I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.
I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.
And they tried everything they had.
They tried the usual psychotherapy.
Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.
By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.
I could blow the depression away.
It was, "Ah, fuck it!"
I stayed there for three years.
My children came back to live with us.
We had two more children after that.
Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life.
It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.
And I've always felt guilty about that.
You can be thrown off the track.
There is redemption. And there is resurrection.
Jennifer 8. Lee hunts for General Tso
There's a piece of paper inside!
You've won a prize!
So, where are they from?
So, how did they get to the United States?
They are more American than anything else.
He's in Taiwan right now.
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong.
I went to his home town.
And I went looking for chicken.
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken.
And then they're like, is this Chinese food?
Now, who came up with the idea of chop suey?
So, you see different varieties of Chinese food.
She's like, "It's not?
And even the Brits have their own version.
He's like, "Oh, I got it from a fortune cookie."
Yeah. So, I went and started looking.
So, a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
So. Thank you very much.
So, you're calling for a global ethic.
Would you describe that as global citizenship?
But we don't necessarily have the means to do so.
So there are challenges to be met.
How do you reconcile the two things?
"How does it feel to be free?"
And that was the 1950s.
GB: Modern communications.
Where was the early warning systems?
So, I come back to my initial point.
Sometimes you think things are impossible.
All these things have happened.
GB: Followed my sword will swallow.
GB: We have a responsibility to protect.
But we did get an agreement on climate change.
Japan has made an announcement.
And we would help them adapt.
The IMF now has limited resources, one percent.
So, we've got to rebuild the world institutions.
So Barroso walked away crying and in tears.
GB: Well, thank you.
I'm thrilled to be here.
So that's kind of a bold statement.
I'll tell you a little bit more.
It actually gets reintegrated in the body.
And the material looks something like this.
So this material is silk.
And so we get this starting material.
They find their way to self-assemble.
And so what does that mean?
It's actually not limited to films.
And so the material can assume a lot of formats.
You can add a third dimensionality to the film.
But you can do other things.
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics.
And you can think of different formats.
You can do bigger things.
And the gears work in water as well.
So you think of alternative mechanical parts.
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap.
But there are still some unique traits.
And you see here a picture of a tissue section.
So we've made a silk card with penicillin in it.
And so what you see there is the difference.

Heather Knight: Silicon-based comedy
So we're based in New York City.
He's named after the Star Trek character.
I think he's going to be super popular.
It knows how much it's moving.
And so it's going to try to watch your response.
If you like what's going on, show the green.
It doesn't have feelings ... yet.
Right, so, let the robot stand-up comedy begin.

It's an honor to be here.
You guys are looking good out there.
Ready for some jokes?
Data: Here's the first one.
"That's terrible," said the patient.
"How can the news possibly be worse?"
Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.
Data: Pretty lucky for them.
You get past me, the guy behind me has a spoon."
HK: He's a French robot.
One of them falls to the ground.
He does not seem to be breathing.
He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.
The operator says, "Just take it easy.
First, let's make sure he's dead."
Question: Why is television called a medium?
Because it's neither rare nor well done.
Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.
Data: I find it incredibly educational.
That's all for now.
Was that okay for my first time?
You've been a great audience.
So thank you all for being a part of it.
There's a lot more to come.
http://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_kaminsky.html
Sarah Kaminsky: My father the forger
My father is no such man.
Let me introduce him.
Here is my father at age 19.
This is me in the middle making faces.
She yelled at me like she never had before.
I heard him come in.
Indeed, it's rather small.
I was born in Algeria.
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"
My father, a secret agent?
It was very James Bond.
So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.
His parents were of Russian descent.
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
But it was only the beginning.
All the movements stopped at falsifying.
He started a press. He started photoengraving.
He started making rubber stamps.
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.
He was broke all of the time.
One day my father introduced me to my sister.
They are both in their sixties now.
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
And then he would not come.
Then one day he totally disappeared.
There was also Latin America.
Then there was the Vietnam War.
Europe was not spared either.
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
He's still dreaming about it.
My father is here in the room today.
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.
Well, the evidence is, unfortunately, ample.
You know, you don't want to stand there.
These include, of course, climate.
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.
In the '50s, we start branching out.
Now the question then is: how gloomy is this?
Is then sustainable development utopia?
Well, there's no science to suggest.
This is a new paradigm.
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.
But is it happening anywhere?
So crisis leading into opportunities.
Now, what about the future?
It has to basically do this on current land.
And we need a transformation.
And what shall we do?
You get people out of poverty.
and then backtrack innovations within that.
So, there is scientific evidence.
art,creativity,design,illusion
Vik Muniz makes art with wire, sugar
Creativity is how we cope with creation.
See, for instance, in this picture.
You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
You didn't trust information very much.
On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
The first works were actually objects.
And I called them relics.
This is the clown skull.
They lived in Brazil, long time ago.
This is the Ashanti joystick.
The rocking podium.
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker.
So I decided to do work with clouds.
Because clouds can mean anything you want.
And he did something that was very tricky.
And it's totally overkill.
And your eye doesn't know which level to read.
And I wanted to deal with other subjects.
So this is a lighthouse.
I got some photographs from them.
So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
And Jackson Pollock also.
This is Richard Serra.
So they're like perfect actors.
Well, I think that's it.
My time is nearly up.
DNA,biology,evolution,science
Svante Pääbo: DNA clues to our inner neanderthal
In this case, it's very simple.
Well we can begin to ask those questions also.
And it's a lot: 38 million variable positions.
This may be surprising.
Maybe a single individual is misclassified or so.
So this is very surprising.
What happened to the Neanderthals?
Does it match one African or the other African?
And that's indeed the case.
Well I don't think that is the case.

Stanley McChrystal: Listen, learn ... then lead
And you put on the T-10 parachute.
You didn't really want to jump, but you want out.
They give 20 minutes -- that's a time warning.
Then they give you 10 minutes.
Then they give you, "Get ready."
Then they go, "Outboard personnel, stand up."
If you're an inboard personnel, stand up.
And at that point, you think, "Hey, guess what?
I'm probably going to jump.
There's no way to get out of this at this point."
So nice air comes flowing in.
The jumpmasters start to check the door.
Jump is a misnomer; you fall.
But typically you do; typically it opens.
Now you prepare for the inevitable.
You are going to hit the ground.
You can't delay that much.
It's this elegant little land, twist and roll.
And that's not going to hurt.
In 30-some years of jumping, I never did one.
This was my father in Vietnam.
And I still believe real leaders are like that.
And I'm not sure that was real interaction.
And I had an armored organization at that point.
The enemy didn't break a sweat doing it.
Sort of leadership by humiliation.
But everything we do is in a different context.
I have to have trust in them and vice versa.
And I also have to build their faith.
And that's a new kind of leadership for me.
The mission didn't work.
Entirely new requirement.
Also, the people had changed.
I asked, "Where were you on 9/11?"
And yet, we need to have that shared sense.
And it's a brand new leadership challenge.
And yet, again, you're not all in one room.
Then another thing.
There's an effect on you and on your leaders.
There's an impact, it's cumulative.
And I remembered his son was in our force.
And he said, "Sir, he's fine. Thanks for asking."
I said, "Where is he now?"
Think about knowing that over time.
And it's a new cumulative pressure on leaders.
I probably learned the most about relationships.
Think about it. It's extraordinarily powerful.
It's probably more powerful than marriage vows.
That was my journey.
I hope it's not over.
This isn't easy stuff.
And it isn't always fair.
art,arts,culture,design,entertainment,race
It's always what it was and what it can be.
Now, what does this mean to some of you?
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.
And then, of course, to bring us to today.
And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."
What can artwork say about this?
It is why I look to art.
It's why I ask questions of art.
It is why I make exhibitions.
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?
So, what do I discover when I look at artworks?
What do I think about when I think about art?
Jamais Cascio on tools for a better world
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
And it's just going to get more wild.
That's understandable and important.
The key components are already widely available.
And that's worth noting in particular.
Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education
Make yourself understood to the computer."
So the children said, "How do we do that."
And I said, "I don't know, actually."
So they could do that on their own.
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
This is a 15 year-old boy.
SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?"
They would, you know, throw it back at you.
They'd say, "This is very boring."
This is what these children are doing.
They are trying to multiply, I think.
And indeed they had.
I wanted to test the limits of the system.
I called in 26 children.
It's all in English, and I'm going.
So I left them with it.
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
They said, "Yes, we did."
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."
They said, "We look at it every day."
It took me three years to publish that.
And then that's her over there.
Remember, they don't study English.
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.
But 30 percent is not a pass.
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
She said, "What's that?"
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.
I made them into groups of four.
I said, "You make your own groups of four.
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
"You can exchange groups.
I gave them six GCSE questions.
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
I said, "Well, let's try it.
I'll come back after two months.
200 of them volunteered immediately.
The granny cloud sits over there.
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.
Teacher: You can't catch me.
You can't catch me.
Children: You can't catch me.
Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man.
Children: I'm the gingerbread man.
Teacher: Well done. Very good ...
Two children watch a TEDTalk.
They wanted to be footballers before.
It's pretty simple stuff.
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.
The mediator is from Pune, India.
I went to Turin in May.
The children looked at it and said, "What?"
I said, "Well, do it."
This one, they took only 10 minutes.
I tried a really hard one then.
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
This sent shivers up my spine.

But they wouldn't give me an answer.
So, blue, blue, everything became blue.

Some of you may recognize this image.
50-million-plus views on YouTube.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
They wanted us to make use of the space.
It included an exterior loading dock.
The machine itself would start the music.
They wanted it to end precisely on time.
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
And it's actually in the machine.
So what did we learn from all of this?
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
What else? Planning is incredibly important.
Again, small to large is relevant here.
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.
Let me start again.
Sorry, start again.
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.
Did I mention they're gorgeous?
And they're scientific models?
They were developed in Japan pretty recently.
Okay, induced pluripotent stem cells.
This is a degeneration of the retina.
Well, this is another trend in the field.
Paul MacCready on nature vs. humans
This is unprecedented, and it's big.
Now, the third curve is information technology.
It's just going up through the roof.
This was the full size of the original creature.
The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.
It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.
Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.
But now let's look at the other end.
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?
We get to do the classic.
If this hits you, it will not hurt you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
But there's a lot of technology going.
But you're beginning to see what can be done.
And so where it all goes, I don't know.
MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.
The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.
We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.
So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.

Elizabeth Murchison: Fighting a contagious cancer
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.
She hadn't eaten for days.
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.
Of course, they died along with the mother.
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.
The next slide is going to be gruesome.
I took these back to the lab.
I extracted DNA from them.
But how can a cancer spread in a population?
Well the answer is, it has.
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.
We also believe this cancer might be very old.
This cancer is remarkable.
It's a living relic of the distant past.
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.
Could cancers be contagious between people?
However, under some circumstances, it can happen.
Why has the record been so poor?
Try and build a political settlement first.
So, short-term peacekeepers.
So that's the conventional approach.
I think that approach denies reality.
We see that there is no quick fix.
There's certainly no quick security fix.
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.
And the loser is unreconciled.
Why does the politics get easier?
And why is it so difficult initially?
And that doesn't produce a productive politics.
So that is what you get when you face reality.
The first actor is the Security Council.
It is a cost-effective approach.
It does increase security.
But it needs to be done long-term.
That's one actor, the Security Council.
The donors provide post-conflict aid.
They moved on to some other situation.
You can do that quite fast.
And there are two key things it's got to do.
It's got to reform economic policy.
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.
So those three actors.
And they are interdependent over a long term.
And so we need a post-conflict compact.
So that's idea one: recognize interdependence.
So jobs, health, and clean government.
Those are the three critical priorities.
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them.
And why are jobs so important?
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.
It's because young men get upset.
Now, that is difficult.
That is not a good idea.
It's not sustainable.
During conflict people are doing destruction.
What might the bottlenecks be?
First you need access to land.
We need firms. The firms have gone away.
Neither of those approaches is sensible.
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
Clean means follow their money.
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?
So that's the focus on the construction sector.
Where would that leave us?
Joseph Nye on global power shifts
That's important and it's an important shift.
Now that's a big abstract number.
Anybody can play in the game.
The technology was there.
The State still matters.
But the stage is crowded.
We think in terms of war and interstate war.
So let me step back and ask: what's power?
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.
First of all, it's a linear projection.
History is not linear.
It's all very one-dimensional.
But you might ask, well so what in any case?
Why does it matter? Who cares?
The answer is it matters quite a lot.
Let me give you an example from history.
Notice both halves of that explanation.
No, I think that's wrong.
Top board: military power among states.
Power is multi-polar.
Power is chaotically distributed.
It's one in which we can all gain.
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.
Wars persist. Power persists.
Military power is important.
Keeping balances is important.
All this still persists.
Hard power is there, and it will remain.
And that's the good news I have. We can do that.
cities,climate change,global issues
Vicki Arroyo: Let's prepare for our new climate
This is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.
Half the city is already below sea level.
And how will they cope in a foreign land?
It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.
Like it or not, ready or not, this is our future.
So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.
Second, preparing for heat and drought.
It's giving them access to affordable credit.
Third, adapting to rising seas.
That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.
Infrastructure is going to be affected.
But now, a word of caution.
Why? Well, there are no experts.
The larger point I'm trying to make is this.
There are no quick fixes.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
We're all learning by doing.
But the operative word is doing.
Jay Walker on the world's English mania
Let's talk about manias.
Manias can be good.
Manias can be alarming.
Or manias can be deadly.
The world has a new mania.
A mania for learning English.
Teacher: ... change my life!
Students: I will change my life.
T: I don't want to let my parents down.
S: I don't want to let my parents down.
T: I don't ever want to let my country down.
S: I don't ever want to let my country down.
T: Most importantly ... S: Most importantly ...
T: I don't want to let myself down.
S: I don't want to let myself down.
Two billion of them.
Students: A t-shirt. A dress.
Why English? In a single word: Opportunity.
25 percent of her grade is based on English.
Teacher: Perfect! Students: Perfect!
T: Perfect! S: Perfect!
T: I want to speak perfect English.
S: I want to speak perfect English.
T: I want to change my life!
S: I want to change my life!
JW: So is English mania good or bad?
English is the world's second language.
Your native language is your life.
The world has other universal languages.
Mathematics is the language of science.
Music is the language of emotions.
So English mania is a turning point.
John Hunter on the World Peace Game
I'm very fortunate to be here.
I feel so fortunate.
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."
It's a true feeling.
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.
Why is this old table in your office?"
It all started back in 1977.
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."
It was an experimental education program.
And I said, "What do I do?"
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.
She said, "What do you want to do?"
And that question cleared the space.
His name is Chris Farina.
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.
But the film has really gone places.
And it's a beautiful thing.
What I saw was my teachers coming through me.
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.
You know that teacher?
And then I saw my own parents, my first teachers.
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.
I am one of her teaching gestures.
It's an amazing feeling to have that lineage.
I'm not here alone.
There are many people on this stage right now.
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.
So I thought, well they like to play games.
And it has four Plexiglass layers.
There are four countries around the board.
And each country has a cabinet.
And they've done it several times too.
I'm just a clock watcher.
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.
The students run the game.
So I'll just share with you ...
Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.
And so I apologize to them as well.
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?
To her girlfriends she said that.
That's a breach there.
They are the toughest opponents.
And we were very upset.
I could not have designed that in teaching it.
Another example, a beautiful thing happened.
We have a letter in the game.
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.
It'll be more realer if she reads it."
She read two sentences.
By the third sentence, she was in tears.
He's been in many battles.
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.
JH: I get chills every time I see that.
But it's self-evident assessment.
So I'll just share a third story.
This is about my friend Brennan.
There was no way they could win.
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.
I should have gotten it so they could have won.
They shouldn't be failing like this.
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.
They get these dossiers full of secret documents.
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.
The parents were looking in the window.
And we've got 600 billion dollars.
Will you accept it?"
And there are three seconds left on the clock.
And the game is won.
Every game we play is different.
Some games are more about warfare.
design,education,play,science,technology
My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.
I've been making toys for the last 30 years.
The early '70s, I was in college.
It was a very revolutionary time.
Many people were inspired by this.
Live with them; love them.
This was kind of the defining slogan.
Well I took one year.
And it was a turning point.
So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here."
This is called a cycle valve tube.
It's like its own little coupling.
And they have some wonderful properties.
You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.
But this is very shaky.
Push it and it becomes house shaped.
This square might look very square and prim.
Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.
It becomes kite-shaped.
Because triangles are the only rigid structures.
They always make a triangular roof.
Now this is people science.
So you make all these 3D shapes.
You make a tetrahedron like this.
And once you make these, you make a little house.
You just need a ton.
You can play around with it.
This makes an igloo.
Now this is in 1978.
I was a 24-year-old young engineer.
I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.
Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.
And this is how you make a valve.
You put a little sticky tape.
This is one-way traffic.
Well we make lots and lots of pumps.
And this is the pump.
It's like a centrifuge.
If you spin something, it tends to fly out.
If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.
There are four pictures.
But this is great fun for children.
They all study about the food chain.
In three minutes, you just fold this up.
With a bigger one, you make a bigger one.
Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.
And you put a little fan here.
And this is a hundred-year-old toy.
There's some grooves over here, you can see.
Six major research papers on this.
He wrote a paper on this.
This is a kind of a blowing straw.
I just put this inside this.
There's a hole here, and I shut this.
What we do is make a very simple electric motor.
Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.
This is a permanent magnet.
When teachers make it, children make it.
You can see a gleam in their eye.
They get a thrill of what science is all about.
And this science is not a rich man's game.
Over 100,000 children learn science this way.
And we're just trying to see possibilities.
You put this in your mouth, and you blow.
And something very, very nice happens.
And this is wool over here.
If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.
Wool sticks on Velcro.
And this has come as a great boon to them.
But this has come as a great boon for them.
There are no patents. Anyone can make it.
This is very, very simple.
These are two magnets.
Small pulley and two strong magnets.
And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.
There will be a spinning magnetic field.
And you can see, this LED is going to glow.
So this is a small crank generator.
This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.
It's a great cricket cap.
And you can see, this is a little fantail bird.
Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.
This is called "The Captain's Hat Story."
The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.
It goes very slowly.
It's been catapulted to international glory.
They were singing and dancing.
Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.
And there's a third one over here.
This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.
It's a high-strength polymer.
So that was a factor-100 saving.
Nature works very differently.
It was ending up in landfills.
Some of you may recognize this.
The converse is also true.
So our energy problems are not intractable.
It's a challenge to our ingenuity.
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.
CSP produces a lot of waste heat.
So this is how this scheme would look.
The next thing is sodium chloride.
This is a hotel in Bolivia.
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.
They're not just possible; they're critical.
And this is an important point.
Stephen Wolfram: Computing a theory of everything
It's the idea of computation.
So, if we run this program, this is what we get.
Now we get another result, still very simple.
Try changing it again.
You get something a little bit more complicated.
So the question is: Can anything else happen?
Well, we can do a little experiment.
They're called cellular automata.
Things with rules as simple as these can do it.
So let's give it a try.
Let's start off with something really easy.
Let's try something a little bit harder.
We could ask it something about the real world.
And it should be able to tell us that.
let's say the revenue of Microsoft.
So let's say we have a lab finding that ...
But that's just the beginning.
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all.
Let me show you a couple of examples here.
But it's something that is very precise stuff.
I think it's actually rather wonderful.
Here's a real simple example.
Let's try this here.
I'll show you one example here.
Okay. Let's zoom out again.
So, will we find the whole of physics?
Not an easy project.
One's got to build a lot of technology.
Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.
Chris Anderson: That was astonishing.
Stay here. I've got a question.
So, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.
CA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.
Does your work relate to his?
CA: Stephen Wolfram, thank you.

We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.

Kakenya Ntaiya: A girl who demanded school
There's a group of people in Kenya.
People cross oceans to go see them.
These people are tall.
They jump high. They wear red.
And they kill lions.
You might be wondering, who are these people?
These are the Maasais.
The girls are brought up to be mothers.
Why did she say that?
My father worked as a policeman in the city.
He came home once a year.
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
When I went to school, I had a dream.
I wanted to become a teacher.
Teachers looked nice.
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
So I wanted to become a teacher.
This was the crossroad.
I did. The ceremony happened.
It's a whole week long of excitement.
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
They were all in a circle.
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
We were taken care of.
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.
Just tell me how to get there."
This gentleman, he helped me.
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
"My child, what are you doing here?"
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."
They all came together.
I was in a land of plenty.
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
Those things made me angry.
I wanted to do something.
I had to do something.
Because there had not been any school for girls.
That made sense. And they agreed.
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
Five months later, that is Angeline.
A transformation had begun in her life.
She was not the top student when we took her.
That's Sharon. That's five years later.
I want to challenge you today.
You are somebody who is so passionate.
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.
Be the first. People will follow you.
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.
Laura Trice suggests we all say thank you
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
So, I decided to investigate.
I know a woman who's good at this.
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
So, the question is, why was I blocking it?
Why were other people blocking it?
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
John Gerzema: The post-crisis consumer
We've questioned the future of capitalism.
We've questioned the financial industry.
We've looked at our government oversight.
We've questioned where we're going.
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.
The consumer is empowered.
Commodity prices are like this.
What is your strategy in your household?
This is something I call the 50-20 paradox.
Do you know what this was right here?
So consumers got overleveraged.
This is an absolutely staggering chart.
It shows leverage, trended out from 1919 to 2009.
So this is the first 315 billion.
However, consumers have moved.
They are taking responsibility.
But that's not really the whole story.
Does anybody know why?
We're going to explain that right now.
We found a couple of really interesting things.
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
The management principle is dollars and cents.
We see high-end haggling in fashion today.
High-end haggling for luxury and real estate.
A couple things that are kind of cool.
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.
So micropayments have become huge.
The consumer is demanding it.
And I'll give you a few examples.
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.
Also a really interesting company is Gore-Tex.
Complete transparency.
Think twice before you have that bottle of wine.
Continuing education is up.
We also see a big DIY movement.
They want these skills.
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
Another great example is Fidelity.
Or the interesting company SunRun.
So, it's a consumer driven co-op.
It's incredibly important right now.
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.
The artisanal movement is huge.
Also this rise of local currencies.
The traditional thing would be to boycott right?
Have a stick? Well why not have a carrot?
And then we look at what companies can do.
You actually need to organize it.
So what credentials does Zagat's have?
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
Or you look at Johnson & Johnson's Momversations.
A phenomenal blog that's been built up.
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
Crisis equals opportunity.
It will drive innovation.

Elif Shafak: The politics of fiction
It will dry up inside.
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.
I started writing fiction at the age of eight.
My mother became a diplomat.
I started writing fiction in English.
And that gap is very intimidating.
And because God loves her, I did get married.
But instead of settling down, I went to Arizona.
I asked him what he meant by that.
It was only because of our passports.
A function is attributed to fiction.
It comes from everywhere.
It was just a story.
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.
The other, in nuances.
One draws boundaries.
The other recognizes no frontiers.
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.
Fiction is flowing water.
Today, stories continue to transcend borders.
Literature has to take us beyond.
Like that, my fiction as well.
It's between buildings.
I'm intrigued by this concept.
I like it when my characters surprise me.
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.
Brian Cox: Why we need the explorers
This is the U.K. government spend.
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.
That funds everything in the U.K.
So that's what we're arguing about.
So it isn't in the series.
It's of the moon Enceladus.
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
What's fascinating and beautiful ...
It's a beautiful graphic.
That's one more picture of Enceladus.
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.
It's actually an ice moon.
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.
Earthrise from Apollo 8.
So exploration can pay for itself.
What about scientific discovery?
What about driving innovation?
And they saw strange pictures like this.
And that's why helium's called helium.
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
That's quite an incredible prediction.
Well, this is a picture of it.
So that star is also 50 million light years away.
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.
And if I blow it up there, you see it.
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.
The Voyager is a tiny machine.
And it took this picture of Earth.
That's Earth from four billion miles away.
He said, "Consider again that dot.
That's here. That's home. That's us.
Surely, we know enough.
He was clearly under assault all the time.
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.
Just exploit it; just build things."

Derek Sivers: Weird, or just different?
This is 26th, that's 27th."
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.
There's Block 17, house number one."
The second house ever built is house number two.
And this map is also accurate.

Gary Kovacs: Tracking the trackers
And this is my profile.
So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.
Now let me stop here.
I have navigated to a total of four.
The red dots have exploded.
The gray dots have grown exponentially.
I look at this picture and it freaks me out.
And why is this happening?
Pretty simple -- it's huge business.
And as adults, we're certainly not alone.
I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.
We can't sit idly by here either.
This is happening today.
Today we've launched Collusion.
Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.
Because the memory of the Internet is forever.
We are being watched.
It's now time for us to watch the watchers.

John Francis walks the Earth
Thank you for being here.
And I said, "Thank you for being here."
Well, I want to take you on this journey.
That’s a big thing in California.
You’re walking to make us feel bad."
I called my parents up.
I didn’t know about the environment then.
They’re back in Philadelphia.
Mothers are like that.
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.
And then I would launch in.
Well, that just ended communication.
So on this first day I actually listened.
I was 27. I thought I knew everything.
Well, that lasted 17 years.
It’s only 500 miles.
I had a newspaper clipping.
"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?
We have a special program for you." They did.
And my father came out, he was so proud.
I said I'd be there in about two years.
There are two stories in Montana.
And they said,"Don't worry about that."
You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?"
All the students sat around and they went ...
They had to take that class with me.
"Well, you can’t clearcut with a ..."
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?"
I spent two years there writing on oil spills.
No one was interested in oil spills.
But something happened -- Exxon Valdez.
My dad came out again.
Well, I put on my backpack again.
And that’s communication.
Well, my journey kept going on.
"Yeah, I want to make a difference."
"You’re going to make a difference, buddy."
How could that be, how could that be?
And so that’s the message that I had.
And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?
And I started walking off.
What possessed me to say this thing?
The road turned into the jungle.
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.
Now how could that be?
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
You know, we can do it.
I was going to have to change.
I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.
But I know I needed to.
We have to change now.
children,education,food,science,writing
My subject today is learning.
When does learning begin?
Now I'm a science reporter.
I write books and magazine articles.
And I'm also a mother.
How can we know this?
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
It's also tastes and smells.
And often it does something more.
The specter of mass starvation loomed.
But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.
But that may not be all that's going on.
Here's another story.
1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
Marco Tempest: A magical tale
It's a demonstration of augmented reality.
They are live and reacting to me in real time.
So fingers crossed.
And keep your eyes on the big screen.
Without it, a script is just words.
Augmented reality is just the latest technology.
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief.
Without this ability there is no magic.
Jean Robert-Houdin: A conjurer is not a juggler.
He is an actor playing the part of a magician.
Now many of them are intensely dramatic.
The tricks of magic have one special element.
They are stories with a twist.
MT: In that respect, magic tricks are like jokes.
It's fun to be fooled.
We feel compelled to tell them.
They want to share the experience.
We think in narrative structures.
It's a uniquely human achievement.
Teenaged boy wonders play bluegrass
TM: Thank you, thank you.
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.
And on guitar is my 14-year-old brother, Tommy.
We call ourselves the Sleepy Man Banjo Boys.
TM: Thank you very much.

Rory Sutherland: Sweat the small stuff
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.
Let me give you one example of this.
It may still be, for all I know.
Has anybody stayed there?
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
It's a tiny, tiny thing.
They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?
I said, "It's really, really easy."
Okay, you simply wouldn't.
And yet, it never happens.
That's the world people actually want.
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.
That's called trivia.
But there's a fourth thing.
We don't know what to call it.
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."

Maya Beiser and her cello
It all became music to me.
I didn't hear the boundaries.
I still start every day practicing playing Bach.
Johnny Lee demos Wii Remote hacks
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote.
This is Adobe Photoshop.
So let's switch back to that.
evolution,math,physics,science,universe
How did the universe come into being?
Are we alone in the universe?
Is there alien life out there?
What is the future of the human race?
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.
But was there anything before the Big Bang?
If not, what created the universe?
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.
But we don't know how life first appeared.
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.
Thank you for listening.
CA: Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.
Jessica Jackley: Poverty, money -- and love
This is what Jesus asked of us.
Now I was pretty psyched.
And I felt overwhelmed.
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
And so naturally, I started to distance myself.
And I stopped expecting things to really change.
I mean who can argue with that?
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.
Their business trajectory would change.
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.
That was another thing that really touched me.
So I saw that and it was very humbling.
The money came in basically overnight.
We sent it over to Uganda.
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.
The third year, the total was up to around 40.
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.
So they're not a donation.
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.
But there's always a need for resources close by.
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.
So that's what I'm working on now.
And I think I can remind us that we do care.
I think we all already know that.
culture,design,humor,product design,technology
I'm a designer and an educator.
But how efficient is, really, this multitasking?
A couple of examples.
This is my multitasking activity result.
Another example: Have you ever been to Venice?
Zeresenay Alemseged looks for humanity's roots
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.
You don't need to remember that.
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
You don't just jump into an invitation.
And you find nothing for years and years.
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."
Let's go somewhere else."
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
It took five years.
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
The next exciting question is, girl or boy?
And how old was she when she died?
What do we actually know about our ancestors?
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
That's why we need care from our parents.
But that care means also you learn.
You spend more time with your parents.
It supports your tongue from behind.
It's, in a way, your voice box.
It determines the type of voice you produce.
What does that tell us?"
They don't preserve well, as you know.
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.
That's what I call positive African attitude.
David Gallo shows underwater astonishments
There's a flying turkey under a tree.
I'm a geologist by training. But I love that.
And a lot of what goes on inside ...
there's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.
Just absolutely amazing, every single dive.
And the male ... We're going to see it again.
And there he is, his droopy little eyes up here.
But they can do pretty amazing things, too.
Disappears right into the background.
Positively amazing. Here's two males fighting.
That's an amazing thing.
Here's some algae in the foreground ...
That big brown makes his eyespot very big.
Watch the skin color; watch the skin texture.
Kristina Gjerde: Making law on the high seas
It's a place of myth and legend.
We are talking about the high seas.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
And how did we do that?
It's actually a bay.
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
They fly 65,000 kilometers in less than a year.
So stay tuned for further information.
We have the support of governments now behind us.
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
Richard St. John's 8 secrets of success
She said, "What leads to success?"
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.
And the first thing is passion.
Freeman Thomas says, "I'm driven by my passion."
Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun."
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!
And push! David Gallo says, "Push yourself.
You gotta push through shyness and self-doubt.
Goldie Hawn says, "I always had self-doubts.
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.
I didn't think I'd make it."
Because that's the way people really get rich."
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
And I give lots of evidence.
Thank you TED-sters for all your interviews!
Adam Ostrow: After your final status update
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.
Consider a few stats for a moment.
Adam Ostrow: Hello.

Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?
science,sustainability,technology
Paul Gilding: The Earth is full
Here they are: The Earth is full.
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.
But that's not possible, you might think.
We can't stop economic growth.
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.
Come on, you're thinking.
That's not possible.
Technology is amazing. People are innovative.
We can surely sort this out.
Well, it's mostly true.
China plans to be there in just 20 years.
We need it to develop technology.
We need it to keep social stability.
It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.
And these are not esoteric limits.
And that's what will happen to us.
If it's that bad, we'll react.
Let's just think through that idea.
Now we've had 50 years of warnings.
We've had science proving the urgency of change.
We're not even slowing down.
I actually don't say this in despair.
I've done my grieving about the loss.
I accept where we are.
It is sad, but it is what it is.
So when does this transition begin?
When does this breakdown begin?
In my view, it is well underway.
I know most people don't see it that way.
I want to talk to you about fear.
The crisis is now inevitable.
This issue is, how will we react?
Of course, we can't know what will happen.
The future is inherently uncertain.
But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.
You can't see the danger at your door.
And the good news, this one's a monster.
We can do it with proven technology.
We can do it at an affordable cost.
We can do it with existing political structures.
And this is where you come in.
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating.
We need to act like the future depends on it.
We need to act like we only have one planet.
We can be more, we can be much more.
We can choose life over fear.
This could be our finest hour.

Tim Harford: Trial, error and the God complex
It's the Second World War.
A German prison camp.
He doesn't know how to cure it.
And he's operating in a hostile environment.
And people do terrible things in wars.
The German camp guards, they've got bored.
He said he heard suspicious laughter.
So the situation seemed pretty desperate.
But Archie Cochrane was a resourceful person.
It looks like crude oil.
He gives half of them vitamin C.
He gives half of them vitamin B12.
And he had a name for it.
He called it the God complex.
And doctors suffer from the God complex a lot.
I see it in our business leaders.
Well let me give you an example.
You know Hans: the Mick Jagger of TED.
And they are brilliant; it's wonderful work.
Three pieces of data is nothing.
I mean, have a look at this graph.
This is produced by the physicist Cesar Hidalgo.
And it's wonderful, wonderful work.
Five thousand products -- that's still nothing.
Imagine you had one second per product category.
This is how complex the economy we've created is.
And I'm just counting toasters here.
I'm not trying to solve the Middle East problem.
The complexity here is unbelievable.
You could count them in five minutes.
This baby was produced through trial and error.
I realize that's an ambiguous statement.
Maybe I should clarify it.
This baby is a human body: it evolved.
You could use it in an industrial context.
So let's say you wanted to make detergent.
You pump it at a high pressure through a nozzle.
You create a spray of detergent.
Then the spray dries. It turns into powder.
It falls to the floor.
You scoop it up. You put it in cardboard boxes.
You sell it at a supermarket.
You make lots of money.
How do you design that nozzle?
It turns out to be very important.
Even this problem, too complicated.
You create 10 variations on that one.
You try out 10 variations on that one.
You see how this works, right?
We have no idea why it works, no idea at all.
How did it become the world's greatest economy?
That is a huge failure rate.
I sometimes wonder.
It's come through trial and error.
Obviously trial and error is very important.
Obviously experimentation is very important.
So I say, okay, fine.
You think it's obvious?
I want to fix our education system.
I have no idea how to do it.
I have half a dozen ideas.
Then we'll test some other ideas out.
We'll find some that work. We'll build on those.
It's so uncomfortable.
All the cardiac doctors tried to shut him down.
They had the God complex in spades.
They're not statistically significant.
But we have something.
And it turns out that you're right and I'm wrong.
They should be in hospital."
Shut it down at once."
And there's this huge hubbub.
Archie lets it die down.
rolls through the meeting room.
But Cochrane would do that kind of thing.
I do not want to have my opinions challenged.
I do not want to have my conclusions tested."
And you sometimes need to be shocked out of that.
Now I'm not going to pretend that this is easy.
It's incredibly painful.
You prove one, you prove the other.
But it was always a conjecture.
He made a lot of mistakes.
But he made mistakes in a good direction.
Steven Levitt on child carseats
And the people thought, "You know, you're right.
And the people were happy. They were satisfied.
But he knew about the cheap and simple one.
We would lose all of our market."
And so, anyway, here I am. It's not a fairy tale.
So, this is the data I just showed, OK?
And that's that middle set of bars.
And I think this isn't just chance.
And I said, "That's a great idea."
And then, here's how the crash test works.
So I just wanted you to look at this.
So, let me show you what happens.
These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.
The car seat's moving all over the place.
Bear in mind there are two things about this.
And this crash would have been about a 450.
So that kid would do fine in the crash.
And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.
They were almost impossible to swallow.
But it's obviously a critical question.
Juan Enriquez shares mindboggling science
So let's start talking about that.
That's what I have behind myself.
But of course what we have to remember is this.
And somehow it will all make sense.
But anyway, let's start with the economy.
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
We all love Santa Claus, right?
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
We're going to start to pay them.
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
And he gave an interview in December.
Here's his first bit of advice.
And here's his second bit of advice.
And then all bets are off.
Let me show you what it looks like.
This is an actual bill.
And it's 10 triliion dollars.
The orange slice is what's discretionary.
Everything else is mandated.
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.
Your 401 just got nailed.
Sixty-eight is young today.
We've got to limit other mandatory spending.
I got what you're thinking.
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.
That's the short term. That's the flame part.
That's the financial crisis.
And that's what we've got to keep growing.
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
And start building stuff.
Here was one of the first things they built.
So, cells have this cycle.
First they don't grow.
Then they grow exponentially.
Then they stop growing.
This got a bit more complicated two years later.
They started competing.
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.
And that was very cool stuff back then.
Two years ago, you saw this creature.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
It's almost like leaving Congress.
This should not surprise you, right?
I mean, you're born with no teeth.
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
You re-grow a set of teeth.
And we can do it with other things.
She's now running around with her kids.
This is kind of getting boring, right?
I mean, you understand where this story's going.
But, I mean it gets more interesting.
This may be one of the ultimate papers.
Third trend: robots.
And all we've got is a Roomba.
This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog."
These are not the only interesting robots.
He came within about a second of qualifying.
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.
And the same thing is happening in eyes.
And then they'll be able to see shape.
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.
It is common for hominids to evolve.
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.

Kevin Kelly on the next 5,000 days of the web
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.
It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.
And it turns out that that's not what it was.
And so I began to think about that.
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.
What are the dimensions of this machine?
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.
There's two million emails per second.
So it's a very big number.
Of course, the memory is really huge.
So let me go through those three things.
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
So the machine is computing.
And everything will go through the Web.
And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.
They're going through the machine.
They're going to speak the Web language.
They're going to talk to the machine.
And so every thing will be part of the Web.
The media wants to be liquid.
Those are the effects that we're going to see.
Attention is the currency.
So that's what we were doing.
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
So I'll give you one kind of an example.
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.
But what's it's doing is sharing data.
So we have this database of things.
So I am open, and being transparent to that.
That is going to be the price.
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
We are going to be the machine.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.
It will know us, and that's good.
And all these devices will be portals into that.
We'll have a better word for it.
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.
It's going to be machine-readable.
And the One is us. We are in the One.
I appreciate your time.

Diane Benscoter on how cults rewire the brain
My journey to coming here today started in 1974.
That's me with the funny gloves.
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
They were called deprogrammers.
And I then became a deprogrammer.
I started going out on cases.
And so they took them to some safe place.
And about 20 years went by.
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?
Because something did.
It was on Jonestown.
And it had a chilling effect on me.
These are the dead in Jonestown.
Their mates were chosen for them.
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.
I understand how this could happen.
And so what is this? How does this work?
I was really idealistic.
What happens is that circular logic takes over.
"Moon is one with God.
All I have to do is humbly follow.
It becomes impenetrable.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And that, strange as it may sound, gives me hope.

Heribert Watzke: The brain in your gut
It changed the way our history developed.
But we see the results of this technology, still.
So let's make a little test.
Turn and face your neighbors.
Please, also on the balcony.
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.
Do you -- Do you see any Canine teeth?
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.
It's for cooked food.
We talk about ourselves as omnivores.
We are the animals who eat cooked food.
No, no, no, no. Better -- to live of cooked food.
So cooking is a very important technology.
And you need some design to be successful.
Because brains are expensive.
Those have to pay tuition fees know.
But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.
It's very expensive.
We walked out of Africa two times.
We populated all the ecologies.
It keeps also your brain working.
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.
You can continue to innovate and invent.
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.
But how did it actually run this show?
How did it actually interfere?
What kind of criteria did it use?
And this is actually taste reward and energy.
Umami -- this is a meaty taste.
You need proteins for muscles, recovery.
So satisfaction was a very important part.
And as I say, energy was necessary.
This is what we are using."
And actually you use it and it's actually useful.
It penetrates the mucosa.
It has 20 different neuron types.
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
It's this brain which makes this reflex.
Now how do the two brains work with each other?
At least in my case, they are not listened to.
The more usual case is overeating.
We have transferred enough energy."
This we found from bariatric surgery.
That then the signal would be very, very high.
This is fat digestion.
This is an in vitro experiment.
It's very difficult to work in the intestine.
And the way Clayton put it was this way.
We all have children.
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.
Why did we use that word, science?
It means things happen.
The cause of suffering is ignorance.
You start off at 11,500 feet.
You run up to 15,000 feet, descend 3,000 feet.
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?
And where does the river rise?
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.
Their central metaphor is a loom.
They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."
And this is one of those initiates.
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.
They call themselves the Elder Brothers.
So, their entire year has been cut in half.
These are not dying peoples.
The world remains a rich tapestry.
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.
They're unique facets of the human imagination.
Our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old.
This does not have to happen.
Eben Bayer: Are mushrooms the new plastic?
And this isn't just found in packaging.
And that's not the only place it's found.
They're not biologically compatible.
You'll find it inside of you.
The first is feedstocks.
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.
In our process, we basically use it as a glue.
It's a waste product.
But it's much faster than conventional farming.
The last step, of course, is application.
In this case, we've grown a corner block.
The first reason is local open feedstocks.
Biological yield is really important.
And I think that can be some really good news.

Peter Donnelly shows how stats fool juries
So here's what you do.
And then one of two things will happen.
I was coming back to visit her.
Don't tell her I said that.
So when her colleague said, "What does he do?"
She paused and said, "He models things."
Can you imagine tossing a coin successively?
So suppose we toss a coin repeatedly.
The next time, after the 15th toss.
That's what I want this side to think about.
So what's going on here?
OK. So most people think B is true.
It's not. A is true here.
It takes longer, on average.
Anything different about the two patterns?
There is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.
You can't do that with head-tail-tail.
That turns out to be important.
There are two ways of thinking about this.
I'll give you one of them.
So imagine -- let's suppose we're doing it.
And if it comes down a head, that's great.
You're done, and you celebrate.
On this side, there's a different experience.
Then you toss the coin.
If it's a tail, you crack open the champagne.
It's another way of getting the intuition.
What's the point I want to make?
How long will those chunks be?"
You know about the Human Genome Project.
Why do we care about that?
Well, there are lots of reasons.
That's one big project.
Why do we want to do that?
We don't know what causes them.
It gets it right 99 percent of the time.
What's the chance that they do?
The test gets it right 99 percent of the time.
So a natural answer is 99 percent.
Who likes that answer?
Come on -- everyone's got to get involved.
Don't think you don't trust me anymore.
That's what you might think.
So let me try and illustrate that.
So now suppose we test them all.
It'll only get it wrong one percent of the time.
Here's the key intuition.
Each of them taken together is unlikely.
So where did he get the one in 73 million number?
And secondly, it's palpably false.
It's worse than silly -- it's really bad science.
That's the first problem.
Now, that's a logical error.
It's exactly the same in this context.
The other explanation is that she was guilty.
Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.
We don't know what it is.
We know the children died.
And they're both implausible.
Many cases were reviewed.
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty.
That's an issue in our everyday lives.
It's something we're bad at doing.
That's what engineers do."

John La Grou plugs smart power outlets
This is a world-changing invention.
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.
So how does electricity ignite residential fires?
Our invention had to address all of these issues.
So what about circuit breakers?
So far we've applied for 414 patent claims.

Charles Limb: Building the musical muscle
This is what we want out of our senses.
We want beauty; we don't just want function.
Likewise for hearing.
Really what we want to hear is music.
She's in a very supportive environment.
Her mother's doing everything she can.
Okay, play that video please.
Mother: That's an owl.
Back then you couldn't even look at the eardrum.
It's surgically placed inside the inner ear.
But here is that same girl who is implanted now.
This is her 10 years later.
If we could play this video please.
John Niparko: So you've written two books?
Girl: I have written two books.
Girl: No, the other one was a book.
Do you remember writing that chapter?
Girl: Yes I do. I remember writing every chapter.
So it comes in handy to not be annoyed by her.
JN: I see. And who is that?
Mother: Her sister. Girl: My sister.
JN: And how can you avoid being annoyed by her?
CL: And so she's phenomenal.
Now there are a lot of reasons for that.
Music is entirely different.
Now if we could just play this.
Go ahead and play this one.
And it might be that you kind of like that.
That's kind of hypnotic.
And the second one.
Go ahead and play that.
I had patients tell me that those sound the same.
And yes, there is hope.
Now I don't know if anybody knows who this is.
This is ... does somebody know?
Because his grave was exhumed.
The brains remain hardwired for music.
Text: Beethoven doesn't excite her.
The "1812 Overture" isn't worth waking for.
But she jumps to action when called to duty!
Now I want to show you one last video.
And here's a video of Joseph.
Joseph: I was born in 1986.
Not long after, I was fitted with hearing aids.
And it was absolutely wonderful.
Since then, I've never looked back.
CL: Joseph is phenomenal. He's brilliant.
There are almost no deaf surgeons anywhere.
You don't actually have to hear it.
And I want to thank you for your time.
Paul Rothemund casts a spell with DNA
And so this idea has a lot of traction with us.
So how many of you know what I'm talking about?
So that's great. So that was too easy.

Peter van Uhm: Why I chose a gun
Some chose the microscope as their instrument.
Some chose the pen.
Others work through the instrument of money.
Ladies and gentlemen, I made a different choice.
Ladies and gentlemen -- I share your goals.
I chose this instrument.
It may even feel scary.
A real gun at a few feet's distance.
You could even hear it.
It means The Netherlands is a peaceful country.
The Netherlands is not at war.
Guns are not a part of our lives.
In many countries it is a different story.
They are oppressed.
Weapons can do a lot of harm.
They are the cause of much distress.
Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?
Today I want to tell you why.
And I want to tell you how this gun can help.
The Nazis invaded The Netherlands.
Their grim plans were evident.
They meant to rule by means of repression.
Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
Only brute force remained.
It was our last resort.
My father was there to provide it.
When he aimed, he never missed.
He fired. Nothing happened.
No German soldier fell to the ground.
He could have done something.
So this story stayed with me.
They liberated my birth town.
I do not like guns.
Now this may sound contradictory to you.
Why has violence decreased?
Has the human mind changed?
Or is there something else?
Now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel.
It enhances peace even further.
Where there is no conflict, trade flourishes.
It takes hard work, often behind the scenes.
Because she wants a better world.
Ray Kurzweil on how technology will transform us
Well, it's great to be here.
I've been quite interested in both.
It's kind of taken on a life of its own.
Cell phones were adopted in about eight years.
But you see a very clear trend.
Supercomputers -- same thing.
You could buy 10 million in 2002.
And this is a very widespread phenomena.
We'd like to actually turn that program off.
And this technology is also accelerating.
It's now under a 10th of a cent.
This is based on the number of hosts.
And this is less futuristic than it may sound.
These things have already been done in animals.
Where will we get the software?
It turns out that we can understand it.
That was strictly a capital-markets phenomena.
This will be a routine feature in a cell phone.
So let me just end with a couple of scenarios.
By 2010 computers will disappear.
Machines can share their knowledge very quickly.
We are going to merge with our technology.
These are very powerful technologies.
They both empower our promise and our peril.

Matthew Childs' 9 life lessons from rock climbing
Most of them are pretty basic.
Number two: hesitation is bad.
So momentum is good. Don't stop.
Rule number three: have a plan.
This climber is on the last pitch of it.
He's actually right about where I fell.
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.
And all the hard pitches are actually below him.
And then what happens?
You get to the last pitch. It's easy.
And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.
So you've got to focus.
You've got to keep going.
Rule number five: know how to rest.
And of course there is rule number nine.
So don't hang on till the bitter end.
God,faith,neurology,psychology,science,self
It's like a water dowsing device.
And you walk around, and it points to things.
So what I want to talk about today is belief.
I want to believe, and you do too.
It is the default option. We just believe.
We believe all sorts of things.
It's more difficult.
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
So let's do a thought experiment.
Your name is Lucy, okay?
And you hear a rustle in the grass.
But no harm. You just move away.
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
You've just won a Darwin award.
You've been taken out of the gene pool.
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.
And so I think that we evolved ...
So for example, what do you see here?
It's a horse head, that's right.
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.
And is it really a horse?
Or is it more like a frog?
For example, what do you see here?
Yes, of course, it's a cow.
And what do you see here?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.
What do you see here?
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.
Just shout out anything you see.
That's a good audience, Chris.
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.
Anybody see an object there?
Here is what you show subjects.
L-DOPA increases dopamine.
They increase the amount of dopamine.
That is, how accurate we are in finding patterns.
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.
You think people are talking about you.
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.
And we then call that schizophrenia.
And what pattern do you see here?
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.
Maybe a little Photoshopped.
And you see the lamp here, I know.
Because the lights on here.
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.
The impossible crate illusion.
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.
And so your brain is fooled.
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.
But anyway, the point is still made.
Now which one of these looks odd to you?
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?
And you are correct.
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.
Well, why is this happening?
So you recognize Obama immediately.
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?
What's the difference between those?
And I call this process agenticity.
Some patterns are real and some are not.
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.
Some conspiracies really are true.
Explains a lot, maybe.
We did a whole issue on it.
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.
Well, that's a whole other lecture.
So we are natural-born dualists.
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.
It's just a minute and a half.
Go ahead and roll it.
Girl: That would be fine.
So this is a blind test.
Kay, now can you see anything?
Pull it so you can't even see down.
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?
Woman: Take a step here.
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

Marcus Byrne: The dance of the dung beetle
So the question is, where do we start this story?
They are grown completely in a ball of dung.
Its head is down. It's walking backwards.
This is Africa. It's hot.
And the obvious thing to look at is the sun.
And look at what the beetle does.
So how do we test that? Well, that's easy.
So obviously beetles can see polarized light.
But how do they pick up those celestial cues?
That was what was of interest to us next.
So what are they doing when they do this dance?
And see what his response is.
And you see him do it again.
Now we thought, now what could be going on here?
So what we did was design a couple of arenas.
one was hot, one was cold.
We shaded this one. We left that one hot.
It's about the same as yours and mine.
It's up around 55 to 60 degrees centigrade.
Watch how often the beetle dances.
So we described these as cool boots.
It's from a genus called Pachysoma.
This is a dung beetle. Watch what he's doing.
Can you spot the difference?
And his neighbor steals one of his dung pellets.
If it's using landmarks, it will find its home.
So here's our cunning experimenter.
The forage has been displaced to a new position.
So there he is there.
He's about to head home, and look what happens.
We don't know yet what dung beetles use.
Peter Gabriel fights injustice with video
still exists back home.
At first, we were safe in the camp.
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.
The other soldier also came.
Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.
The other one carried Evelyn aside.
Woman: They insisted that I was lying.
No, not at all, no problem, take your time.
Text: You can say a story is fabricated.
Text: You can say a jury is corrupt.
You can say a person is lying.
You can say you don't trust newspapers.
Help WITNESS give cameras to the world.
Ben Saunders: Why bother leaving the house?
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
The pithiest answer to the question "why?"
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.
We don't live to eat and make money.
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.
Many of you will know the story.
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
We have to turn around and come back again.
David S. Rose on pitching to VCs
Good morning. My name is David Rose.
And there are obviously all kinds of things.
Now, how do you do this?
So the most important thing is integrity.
Let's see if you can get this one.
DSR: Close enough! Passion.
You've got to convey passion.
Next up is knowledge.
I mean, I want you to have domain expertise.
I don't know who the players are.
I don't know what the market is like."
So you've got to know your market.
You've got to know your area.
So what else do you require?
I want to know that you have commitment.
That you are going to be here to the end.
Because bad things happen.
You've got to have vision.
You've got to be able to see where this is going.
I don't want another "me too" product.
But on top of that, I also need realism.
And you've got to be able to deal with that.
You need to be coachable.
We've had a lot of experience.
So think about your pitch as a timeline.
It starts off, you walk in the door.
They know nothing at all, whatsoever, about you.
You can go up, you can go down, right?
And it goes from beginning to end.
I have invested tens of millions of dollars."
That's it -- that should get you right there.
And everything has got to be reinforcing this.
Okay, so how do you do that?
Well, first of all, logical progression.
You stop, you've got to figure it out.
You want a nice logical progression.
Start with telling them what the market is.
Why are you going to do X, Y or Z.
And that's two parts.
So it's got to be both sides.
And it's a very tricky path to do it.
So this all feeds in together.
Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here.
Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.
Yes? OK, Steve Jobs.
What are you focusing on?
You're focusing on him! This is Steve Jobs.
The long bullet points are bad.
What's good? Short, short bullet points.
Just give me the headline over here.
Best of all, images. Just a simple image.
And then, you come back to me.
And why this whole thing makes sense.
I don't need all that.
Just give me your company logo.
"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market."
That lets me know the context.
Why is this market worth getting at over here?
I just want to know -- what the heck is it?
You know, don't do a live demo.
No, never do a live demo.
But then, everybody has competition.
But then, I want to know how you're special.
Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational.
You're making X amount per widget.
I want to know what the driver is.
But then comes the ask.
Two million at 100,000.
What's the money in so far? Who invested?
I hope you invested personally.
Because I'm following on.
What's the capital structure up until this point?
This is that rocket going up.
And I'm thinking, "This is really, really great."
And then you take me back to your logo.
Just your logo on the screen.
And I look at the logo -- okay, good.
So, I couldn't even see if I wanted to.
So now, how do I know what's going on here?
What do you think I'm looking at?
You think that I'm looking at that?
So David's top five presentation tips.
Number four: always use remote control.
Have you seen me touch the computer?
No, you haven't. Why not?
Because I'm using remote control over here.
Always use remote control.
But it's not really good as a handout.
Number three: don't read your speech.
It doesn't work, right? Don't read your speech.
And that is how to pitch to a VC.
business,culture,economics,play,social change
I'm here today to start a revolution.
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?
I'm sick and tired of us being last.
We're last place in Europe in innovation.
That's social. Let's look at education.
Last in reading, math and science. Last.
Business: The lowest perception in the E.U.
that entrepreneurs provide benefits to society.
Why as a result, what happens?
So if our engine's broken, guess what?
Last in Europe GDP per capita.
And these are facts, guys.
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.
How did this happen?
I said "play," all right.
Babies play, kids play, adults play.
We don't value play.
In fact, we devalue play.
And we devalue it in three areas.
Let's go back to the same three areas.
Social: 45 years of what?
And instead, what do we value?
To be really, really serious.
We have a serious meme running through.
It's a social gene running through us.
It's a serious gene.
And here's how it works.
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!
But then what happens in step three?
I'm going to give bebko to baba.
It's a crap system.
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"
And we said, "He's five."
What a crime. What a crime.
We don't need mechanized workers.
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?
Autocratic -- do what I say because I'm the chef.
I'm the boss and I know better than you.
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.
It can't be because of play.
Just play, that's a stupid thing."
We have the serious meme in us.
Well I'm going to say no.
Play: our brains are hardwired for play.
Nature isn't stupid, and it selected for play.
Maybe you didn't know that.
Kittens play. We all know kittens play.
They can still hunt, but they can't be social.
It's not the bears that learn how to fish better.
It's the ones that play more.
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.
Yours truly: humans.
It's a universal thing -- we play.
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.
And who are the biggest neotenists?
Humans. We play sports.
We play musical instruments.
We dance, we kiss, we sing, we just goof around.
It is a huge benefit.
As a result, what happens?
These guys are facts.
These are the benefits to play.
We hold ourselves back.
What does this world look like?
Now imagine your workplace.
Is it fun? Is it playful?
He's going to think I'm not working hard."
The opposite of play is not work.
In fact, play improves our work.
For example, it stimulates creativity.
It increases our openness to change.
It improves our ability to learn.
Our thinking is backwards.
We shouldn't be feeling guilty.
We should be celebrating play.
Quick example from the corporate world.
FedEx, easy motto: people, service, profit.
People, service, profit.
Play increases productivity, not decreases.
No way. We're different."
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.
One, play is universal.
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.
Not one customer would refer us.
We had marginal profit -- I did.
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?
Basically promoting fun.
It does, and it can, work in Bulgaria.
First of all, you have to believe me.
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.
I'm going to let you challenge authority.
We're not always right as leaders.
We're going to eradicate fear.
Fear is the enemy of play.
Let them be on the Internet.
Let them be on instant messengers.
Let them take long lunches.
Lunch is like the recess for work.
Is that all there was?"
Unacceptable. Nepriemliv.
We don't need a workers' revolution.
What we need is a players' uprising.
Seriously, we need to band together.
Today is the start of the uprising.
David Hoffman on losing everything
I had a fire nine days ago.
I mean, this was -- was I my things?
I cherish the future.
This was bad! Man, I was -- I cough. I was sick.
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
That's me at my desk.
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.
You know -- all the stuff.
That's my daughter, Jean.
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
"Dig it up," I said. "Pieces.
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
So I started to say, "Hey, man, you are too much!
You could cry about this." I really didn't.
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
The negatives are gone.
That's my daughter and me.
My children, Davey and Henry.
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
Thank you everybody.

Eva Zeisel on the playful search for beauty
And I am illustrating Still.
So this takes care of my age.
This was about 1925.
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
These were just some of the things I've made.
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
I call myself a maker of things.
Industrial designers want to make novel things.
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
Let me tell you some about my life.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
And there I really worked as an apprentice.
I said, I also have a pottery.
I remember that it was quite successful.
And that was in Hamburg.
This was my first job.
Eva Zeisel: Are you sure?
Moderator: Yes, I am sure.
This was a very dangerous accusation.
Weren't you there recently?
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.
AV: That spawned a dating site.
That's a subject that we want to dive into.
These are our three sons.
Misuse of the pronoun.
And I was there with my arms open.
So I was bracing myself for the moment.
And you can see, our eyes were glistening.
And it was also, of course, surreal.
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.
And this was all quite remarkable.
We have charted our love for our child over time.
This, as you know, is an act of heresy.
You're not allowed to chart love.
You're either in love, or you're not in love.
You love, or you don't love.
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.
RG: The far left. AV: No!
AV: Nothing more to be said.
I'll move on to taboo number two.
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.
So Alisa's experience is not isolated.
So it was a very difficult time.
And I think, miscarriage is an invisible loss.
There's really no ceremony, rituals, or rites.
We were despondent.
We said, something is wrong here.
There's something missing from these studies.
It can't possibly be that bad.
As you get older, you become more stable.
So I'm not going to go.
RG: And so in effect, we trade average happiness.
There's another factor in our case.
It's a bad idea. Don't do it."
And we obviously went forward. We did.
Can we move that up a little bit?
RG + AV: Thank you.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.
We don't know which experts to believe anymore.
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.
You can see it in daily life.
And I'm a very small part of this.
I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.
A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.
We know our societies have to radically change.
And here's the problem.
In science, we do experiments systematically.
Some of the ideas are strange.
These are complaints choirs.
It's already immersed in social networks.
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.
culture,global issues,language
Patricia Ryan: Don't insist on English!
I know what you're thinking.
I get that all the time in Dubai.
"Here on holiday are you, dear?"
"Come to visit the children?
How long are you staying?"
Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.
And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.
Now that statistic is quite shocking.
How did those students get all that knowledge?
A language dies every 14 days.
Could there be a connection?
But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.
Actually, not that long ago.
That is a little bit too early.
Well, I don't think so.
We English teachers reject them all the time.
But indeed, that is exactly what we do.
We English teachers are the gatekeepers.
Maybe the barrier would be too universal.
"But," I hear you say, "what about the research?
It's all in English."
It feeds the English requirement.
I ask you, what happened to translation?
And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.
I love it that we have a global language.
We need one today more than ever.
But I am against using it as a barrier.
Case in point, Einstein.
There are lots and lots of tests of English.
So immediately, we're rejecting them.
And to do that, they need a Western education.
It's a circular thing.
But they couldn't get the results they wanted.
So bingo, problem solved.
If you can't think a thought, you are stuck.
My daughter came to England from Kuwait.
It's an Arabic medium school.
So he invented a cost-free solar lamp.
Let us not keep them and ourselves in the dark.
Let us celebrate diversity.
Mind your language.
Use it to spread great ideas.
Charles Leadbeater on innovation
That's 58 billion dollars.
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.
That's the idea of creativity.
More special people, more special places.
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.
So, you're in a big corporation.
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."
They work at their leisure, if you like.
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.
The users can be producers.
This is open; this is closed.
This is new; this is traditional.
There'll be huge professional arguments as well.
They're not reading my brilliant article!"
Those were the two places.
They want to be part of that flow of information.
So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.
What should be the role of public policy?
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business in 2000.
Because basically, he doesn't service them.
You've got two options.
That costs about 100 dollars.
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
And he left in disgust.
And he had a lump of iron.
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.
And he became interested in that.
He said, "Well what are you doing?"
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.
Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.
This time, he comes down.
Another three years.
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.
He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
So, he had a brilliant idea.
And he says, "Oh." He bows.
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.
And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.
So, naturally, they chased him out of town.
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."
And also, actually, I've been your mother.
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
So, in that sense, we're related.
And we see the mother in every being.
And you think of him as nursing you.
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
But, actually, that's practical.
How boring to run around chasing you.
And you look at them, and you see how they are.
You see that furrowed brow in people.
They're driven by this duty and this obligation.
And they're rushing around all stressed out.
But actually they are cruel to themselves.
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.
And you then feel you must act.
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
Never mind. I won't get into that.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
Compassion makes you happy.
George Whitesides: Toward a science of simplicity
The trouble is, I don't.
But I know it when I see it."
I'm going to come back to that in a moment.
So, what is simplicity?
It's good to start with some examples.
Why is that important?
Well, it enables you to drink coffee.
And the two here are just examples.
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.
The teapot problem I'll pose this way.
And that's a simple question.
It's like, what is simplicity?
All of these are possibilities.
What is the state of science?
The components interact with one another.
And it's like the traffic that you see.
And let me reduce this to the simplest level.
We've heard from Bill Gates recently.
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.
The answer is, not a lot.
And that's complexity.
In binary, one is 0001, seven is 0111.
Anything else is more complicated.
They can be on and off. That's binary.
Now wall switches, we all know, fail.
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
And from that comes the Internet.
And then back to simplicity again.
Their behavior is predictable.
So, for example, stones.
That is, you can stack them.
It just is not possible.
So these are the components.
So, how does one do that?
It's a little paper chip.
It wicks its way up into these little branches.
You know, no power required.
So you can't make it too simple.
This is by de Saint-Exupery.
Chris Anderson: Quick question.
CA: Have you started to do that?
How do I put that simply? No.
CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes.
CA: You've got a company set up to ...
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit.
Ze Frank's web playroom
Every presentation needs this slide in it.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
All the points, all the lines -- it's incredible.
Through that, I connect to people.
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.
This was a Mother's Day gift.
Particularly creepy.
This is project called Ray.
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this."
And this is what came to me.
Here's how the song goes.
All right. Stay strong. Peace.
Ze Frank: So -- yeah.
No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
It's actually in the key of B flat.
And have to do something with it."
One stood out in particular.
It was done by a guy named Goose.
That song -- Thank you.
In two weeks, they found him.
I received and email and it said, "Hi, I'm Ray.
I heard you were looking for me."
And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.
It's been an interesting two weeks."
And it makes me think of this.
But the truth is life is being lived there.
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
It's the fundamental force that we're all after.
Sometimes they're very, very simple things.
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract.
And people called in and left messages like this.
Recording: Okay, here's something.
I'm not alone, and I am loved.
I'm really fortunate.
But sometimes I feel really lonely.
We don't have time to play much of it.
You can look at it online.
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.
And so some really nice things came together.
"I voted blue. I voted red.
Together, for our future."
These are very, very cute little things right.
Some came from the winning party.
Some came from the party who had just lost.
But this was the emotional moment.
So one of them was fairly straightforward.
And this was "Scared."
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great."
And I don't have much time.
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.
And I shut that part down.
I was like, "I don't know.
Didn't know I had one."
And I felt badly for not having done a good job.
And so what I decided to do.
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it."
And this is the kind of thing that I got back.
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.
And then a few days later I sent her this.
Jim Fallon: Exploring the mind of a killer
So that's what I normally do.
So I've looked at about 70 of these.
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.
It's really a very precisely timed thing.
You get different kinds of psychopaths.
They had other sorts of brain damage.
Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.
So this is how it's passed from mother to son.
And it does have some consequences.
Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works.
And now the boys and the girls get them.
So that was the idea.
I said, "What the hell are you talking about?"
She then told me about our own family tree.
Well she said, "There is good news and bad news.
Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie."
She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book."
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.
But it doesn't stop there.
Okay, now this gives one a little pause.
But more likely is this.
And they all seemed to be OK.
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.
And now they are close as can be.
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.

Brian Cox on CERN's supercollider
This is the Large Hadron Collider.
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.
We collide them inside giant detectors.
They're essentially digital cameras.
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.
This is a picture about a year ago.
Those magnets are in there.
Yeah, it's a wonderful achievement.
So, you might be asking, "Why?
Absolutely everything.
It's almost like ...
And, as of today, it's made of these things.
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.
But there's a problem.
Can anyone see what it is?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.
H stands for Higgs particle.
Higgs particles have not been discovered.
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."
Higgs particles, if you will.
They're interacting with the Higgs field.
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.
So that's one thing.
Well, they do change in strength.
But they just miss.
Many other things that the LHC could discover.
Gravity separated away from the other forces.
The universe continued to expand and cool.
It continued to expand about 300 million years.
Then light began to travel through the universe.
Absolutely remarkable.
And, the laws of physics. Right?
Edi Rama: Take back your city with paint
In my previous life, I was an artist.
I still paint. I love art.
For 11 years, I was mayor of Tirana, our capital.
We faced many challenges.
He screeched that he would block the financing.
"But why?" I asked him.
So it's time for change.
What are colors doing to us?"
Thirty-seven said no, we don't like it.
"Come on, man! What policemen?
And this was not a misplaced feeling.
It's not about genes.
It's about system, it's about organization.
It's also about environment and respect.
We removed the kiosks.
We put the citizen first, and not the clerks.
I tweet. I love it.
Politics is not just about leaders.
It's not just about politicians and laws.
Our world is defined by the pace of change.
We can all change the world.

Paul Conneally: Digital humanitarianism
Its origins are firmly rooted in the analog age.
And there is a major shift coming on the horizon.
Haiti was a game changer.
Haiti was something we hadn't seen before.
We had basically three requirements.
And we wanted it to be easy to use.
Some 74 percent of people received the data.
96 percent of them found it useful.
And 73 percent of them shared it.
Technology is transformational.
Kibera is one of Africa's largest slums.
You can find out about places of worship.
You can find out about the health centers.
And they are giving a voice to themselves.
and convert it to humanitarian good.
There are no more reasons not to do it.
Chris Abani muses on humanity
So, I thought I should start with some stories.
And she was dark, too.
My mother was English.
I said, "English, mum."
But her Igbo wasn't too good.
So she took me along to translate.
And, "Do you notice any discharges?"
And, "How swollen is your vulva?"
My mother said, "Someone has to."
It was my mother with five little children.
And she told this woman.
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.
But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.
And I was supposed to do this alone.
So, this guy comes with me.
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.
I cried for a very long time.
And afterwards, he didn't say a word.
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.
So, I was born two days after Christmas.
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.
It's your birthday present."
So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.
There were some really bad people there.
I was really worried.
He didn't know what death row meant.
Then I'd say, "How do you know?"
And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.
It doesn't require a tremendous thing.
"Libation, North Carolina, 1999.
I offer to this ground, this gin.
I call a name that could be his.
This is for you, old man.
This gin, this salty earth."
Vijay Kumar: Robots that fly ... and cooperate
No, agile aerial robots like this one.
However, the vehicles you see here are big.
They're not even autonomous.
It consumes about 15 watts of power.
So it has four rotors.
That's basically how this thing operates.
It's actually half the diameter.
It's inversely proportional to R.
So this should be clear in these videos.
Multiple flips, a little more time.
And it shows you how robust the control is.
So why build robots like this?
Well robots like this have many applications.
I'll tell you a little bit more about this.
The robots can be used for transporting cargo.
In fact, they live in a 12-dimensional space.
So we use a little trick.
So this robot minimizes snap.
And it does that avoiding obstacles.
And the obstacles can be moving.
So I want change gears.
And so here we looked to nature.
So this is actually a piece of fig.
So these ants don't have any central coordinator.
They sense their neighbors.
There's no explicit communication.
So this is what we call anonymity.
They're monitoring their neighbors' position.
They're maintaining formation.
The formations can change.
And what if there's no GPS?
So there is no global coordinate system.
And it navigates with respect to those features.
And that's how it populates this map.
So I want to leave you with one last application.
I want to conclude with a music video.
Amos Winter: The cheap all-terrain wheelchair
Why not in countries like the U.S. too?
The road was too rough.
Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.
I rested for a day at home.
The next day I went to my shop.
Now everything is back to normal.
Louise Fresco on feeding the whole world
I'm not at all a cook.
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
So I'm going to bake bread for you.
I have two loaves of bread here.
I didn't know this word until I arrived.
Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.
Who prefers the whole-meal bread?
I have two tentative male hands.
Okay, now the question is really, why is this so?
It's about a traditional way of living.
A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.
And life is really, too.
And this is about good taste, good traditions.
Why do we have this image?
Why do we feel that this is more true than this?
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
It was a mythical past.
Of course, the reality is quite different.
And it actually drove up our yields.
That is the reality of our modern life.
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.
But it has changed the world.
So what is happening?
What happened to our bread in the meantime?
That is, historically, a really unique situation.
We added in more sugar.
So this is the story of bread as we know it now.
And this is where I have to query all of you.
Let's go back to traditional farming.
Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.
But this is a fallacy.
So local food production is out.
So we must find other solutions.
The main driver of that is actually meat.
Can we find a solution to produce more?
Yes. But we need mechanization.
And I'm making a real plea here.
We must feed three billion people in cities.
But yes there are some solutions.
That's where we should move.
That is not necessary.
So what kind of science can we have?
We have much cleverer irrigation.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
It has different functions.
And we also need to re-examine livestock.
Go regional and go to urban food systems.
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.
But we can do a lot more.
Everything is linked together.
There is all kinds of things we can do.
Talk to people in restaurants.
And that frees you up to do other things.
And above all, to me, food is about respect.
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.
It's not about nutrients and calories.
Let me share some of the food with you.
Take some of my bread.
We've never had that before.
So enjoy your bread.
Eat it, and feel privileged.

Dean Ornish: Help the body heal itself
To me, that’s the real natural wonder.
And it’s not a diet.
You just never know.
It’s important, but not enough.
Well, because it helps them get through the day.

It's been a roller coaster ride.
One of them was the remarkable gharial.
And it is a marvelous rain forest.
It really changed my life totally.
They are interested.
And it really works to start with them.
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.
And king cobras feed only on snakes.
Usually they eat something a bit larger.
And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.
Now, what are we doing with all this information?
What's the point of all this?
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
So, the tiger is the icon.
And now the king cobra is a new one.
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?
You drink it in peril of your life.
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.
It has remarkable features.
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
This was actually just taken last year.
Luckily there is still a lot of interest.
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.
Why? How could it happen?
This is a relatively clean river.
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.
And it's a horribly painful death.
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.
So, who is next? Us?
We're still working hard at it.
And it's a bleak future for them.
So, people talk about political will.
And these are powerful water totems.
Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.
You know, most people are terrified of snakes.
Do you have those conversations with people?
How do you really get them to care?
It's not like the teddy bear.
This guy specializes in pit vipers.
Now, the nusha means the high.
CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.
The couple are barely 18 years old.
It was unacceptable.
The mother bears are usually killed.
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.
And we were so unsure that this would work.
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.
He has a telephone booth.
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.
Then there was no looking back at all for us.
We gave cycle rickshaws.
Education. The kids never went to school.
Of course we also had to get the bears in.
And this is what we turn them into.
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.
And the people can hold their heads up high.
culture,entertainment,humor,poetry
Billy Collins: Everyday moments, caught in time
It's a great way to start sentences.
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.
Bugs Bunny is my muse.
So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.
So let us start with the first one.
Narration: "Budapest."
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.
So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.
A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.
The next poem is also rather short.
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.
And it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture.
Narration: "Some Days."
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.
Narration: "Forgetfulness."
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.
I lived in New York City.
And we would visit each other.
And in that way we traded lore with each other.
It's called "The Country."
Narration: "The Country."
Who could sleep that night?
So the little poem is called "The Dead."
Narration: "The Dead."
The dead are always looking down on us, they say.
BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.
If it has a subject, the subject is adolescence.
And it's addressed to a certain person.
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.
So never mind; you're fine just being yourself.
You're loved for just being you.
animals,community,morality,science
Frans de Waal: Moral behavior in animals
This is the launch of my book.
But why would you reconcile after a fight?
That doesn't make any sense.
And so they also reconcile with sex.
But the principle is exactly the same.
And so deep down our nature's actually nasty.
I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.
So these are the pillars of morality.
If you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"
these are the two factors that always come out.
And the other one is empathy and compassion.
And so they're absolutely essential.
So let me give you a few examples here.
And of course, there's food on the box.
Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.
And so they're bringing in the box.
And you can see that they're synchronized.
Now look at what happens at the very end of this.
He takes basically everything.
So there are two interesting parts about this.
And so that's how this all operates.
We do the same task with elephants.
The apparatus is on the left with food on it.
So it's actually fairly simple for them.
And so that's how they bring it in.
But now we're going to make it more difficult.
So it's what we call freeloading.
This was the cooperation, reciprocity part.
Now something on empathy.
And empathy has sort of two qualities.
And the emotional part.
And so empathy has basically two channels.
One is the body channel.
Your average dog has that also.
And that's more limited.
Humans yawn when others yawn.
And it's related to empathy.
It activates the same areas in the brain.
So it is connected.
And consolation behavior, it's empathy driven.
Now we did a very simple experiment.
And so that's how they live.
So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner.
And here you have the two color tokens.
So they have a whole bucket full of them.
And they have to pick one of the two colors.
You will see how that goes.
that this is not a good test for her.
Then the next one is the pro-social token.
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.
And she should actually be choosing blindly.
And so this became a very famous study.
And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys.
So that's the experiment we did.
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes.
The first piece she eats.
So she gives a rock to us. That's the task.
The other one needs to give a rock to us.
And that's what she does.
And she gets a grape and she eats it.
The other one sees that.
She tests a rock now against the wall.
She needs to give it to us.
And she gets cucumber again.
They didn't like this at all.
So let me summarize.
I believe there's an evolved morality.
And I thank you for your attention.
Derek Sivers: How to start a movement
But what he's doing is so easy to follow.
Now, there he is calling to his friends.
It takes guts to stand out like that.
And here comes a second follower.
So a movement must be public.
Now we've got a movement.
And that's how you make a movement.
But let's recap some lessons from this.
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.

A.J. Jacobs: How healthy living nearly killed me
And I've done this in three parts.
So first I started with the mind.
And here's a little image of that.
And this was an amazing year.
It was really a fascinating journey.
So it had its downsides.
But after that, I decided to work on the spirit.
So this is what I looked like by the end.
Thank you for that reaction.
I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski.
I got both of them.
So there was the topiary there.
And there's the sheep.
And I just finished a couple of months ago.
And I have to say, thank God.
Because living so healthily was killing me.
I had to put on sunscreen.
There was the washing of hands.
I had to do that properly.
So that took a lot of time.
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.
Well yeah, I tried that.
Now it's a little extreme, I admit.
So I finished, and it was a success in a sense.
All of the markers went in the right direction.
And it was successful overall.
It was like something out of Caligula.
Without the sex part.
And I finally have stabilized.
It was really a life-changing project.
Let me just tell you two really quickly.
Because we live in such a noisy world.
And it was done in Europe.
So they think it's actually very deadly.
It really impairs cognition.
And our Founding Fathers knew about this.
And just to give you one instance of this: food.
And it has made me a healthier person.
The book about it comes out in April.
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy."
That's my greatest hope.
Molly Crockett: Beware neuro-bunk
So we did an experiment.
This is the amino acid tryptophan.
Cheese? Chocolate? Where did that come from?
I have to say, this sounds awesome.
I could totally have used this 10 minutes ago.
But I didn't find any.
The headline? "You Love Your iPhone. Literally."
So how'd they figure this out?
This time it's not a cheese sandwich.
No, it's a hormone called oxytocin.
You've probably heard of it.
So he's calling oxytocin "the moral molecule."
We see it in supermarkets, on book covers.
What about the clinic?
This sounds great. A lot of people agree.
There's just one problem.
But we're not there yet.
So here's where you come in.
Ask the tough questions. Ask to see the evidence.

Rajesh Rao: A Rosetta Stone for the Indus script
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.
What might they find?
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.
This is no hypothetical question.
They've found small objects such as these.
Here's an example of one of these objects.
Well obviously this is a replica.
But who is this person?
Or perhaps an ordinary person like you or me?
We don't know what any of these symbols mean.
The symbols are most commonly found on seals.
So you see up there one such object.
Now that's a magnificent piece of art.
So how big do you think that is?
Well let me show you.
Here's a replica of one such seal.
So what were these used for?
Which of these hypotheses can be true?
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.
And why was I fascinated?
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.
I'll give you a couple of seconds.
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.
Okay. Left to right?
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.
And so they had to cram the sign.
Languages contain patterns.
Most of you said U, which is right.
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.
Given such patterns, here was our idea.
Here are some examples.
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.
Here's an example of one such text.
Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.
So imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard.
This is a physics and information theory term.
What about the Indus script?
Linguistic scripts occupy the middle range.
Now what about the Indus script?
I even started to get some hate mail.
What does this result really show?
Why is that the case?
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.
And why were they found there?
It's just like our English and Dutch example.
That's our next big challenge.
So as an example, here's a word.
Can you write it using pictures?
I'll give you a couple seconds.
Here's my solution.
There could be other solutions.
Here's a really short text.
So that was pretty exciting.
It looks like we're getting somewhere.
Why should we care?
These are our ancestors -- yours and mine.
What would they tell us?
What would we find out about them? About us?
I can't wait to find out.
Honor Harger: A history of the universe in sound
Space, we all know what it looks like.
This is the planet Jupiter.
So Thomas Watson wasn't listening to us.
We didn't have the technology to transmit.
So what were these strange noises?
Radio could carry sound without wires.
Let's jump ahead again.
It's 1964, and we're back at Bell Labs.
There was a glitch in their soundtrack.
There were pigeons roosting in the dish.
But the noise didn't disappear.

Robert Full on animal movement
Of course, in the challenge there is a prize.
We have to first know what a foot is.
So you go to the literature.
Maybe you're familiar with this literature.
The problem is, there are many, many feet.
How do you do this?
See any common themes? Principles?
What experiments would you run?
Now it turns out that animals can go anywhere.
But it didn't even slow down the animal.
The leg is acting as a foot.
The foot is distributed along the whole leg.
Take a look at what that is!
This one disguises itself as floating algae.
Why is that? The video will show you.
Watch it go over this.
You can see it here well on this debris.
Really simple, but beautiful.
And my assistant's going to help me here.
Did you notice something?
Chris Anderson: Did you touch it?
A little better than nature.
So to our blueprint, we need to add tuned spines.
And watch again, right there -- successful.
This is really, really difficult.
But look at this animal do it!
Can you use this to make a better robot?
For rough surfaces, though, animals add claws.
And you probably feel them if you grabbed it.
So to our blueprint, let's attach claws.
These are all from different insects.
There's an ant crawling up a vertical surface.
Let's look at that ant.
This is when its foot's in the air.
You see what happens?
That pad comes out. And that's where the glue is.
So it's pretty tough to do.
It certainly helps it to hold on.
Now we have something better here.
These are its feet.
Very strange. How do they stick?
So to our blueprint, we split some hairs.
But it makes an incredible Band-Aid.
Here you are, pulling off the Band-Aid.
So we've redefined, now, what a foot is.
And here are RiSE's first steps on an incline.
You have the audio? You can hear it go up.
And that's exactly what he's done.
It's sped up -- again, it's a foot climbing.
You can visualize this now; it's not impossible.
Otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.

Take the financial crisis.
There is a photograph of a boy called David.
It said "David, age 10."

We should be marching towards a global society.

We really can't see very far.
Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.
Here's the first example.
It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.
Very few nonhuman mammals can imitate sounds.
So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.
Well let's look at mothers and calves.
But there are some exceptions.
This plot shows two members of a pair.
They both have that kind of up-sweep.
This is a bad situation.
When there was one boat, not much of an impact.
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.
The world is mostly blue.
It's nearly halfway around the globe.
In '95 they all sang the normal song.
They just sang the cool new west coast song.
Nobody sang the old ones.
You sound very nearby.
That's shown down here.
You only hear the low frequencies.
It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.
But you can still hear that faint call.
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.
I'll describe a couple strategies.
Look what happened by 2000 to the average call.
It's a really important problem.
But collision is a serious problem.
I'll discuss two very promising approaches.
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
The shipping lanes have been moved.
So it's very promising, actually.
But then they often wait there.
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.
They could slow down by about 50 percent.

Other than that, there's not much of a problem.
So what's the data?
So the data on dropping out is amazing.
What's the evidence of wiping out?
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.
And this is two kinds.
It's a social awkwardness.
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.
The problem is these are arousal addictions.
Drug addiction, you simply want more.
Arousal addiction, you want different.
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.
So what's the solution? It's not my job.
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.

You know, like that.
Now, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new.
The interface just kind of disappears.
This is a photographer's light box application.
I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.
Again, the interface just disappears here.
Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.
And I can bring that around, put that up there.
That leads to bad things, like RSI.
So -- again, isn't this great?
Audience: Where's your lab?
It's pressure-sensitive, you can notice.
It's just so much fun playing around with too.
And when I close it, it becomes a character.
And you notice what it does.
Emiliano Salinas: A civil response to violence
I was born in 1976.
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.
I think we have a problem in Mexico.
We have a big problem.
I think there's consensus on this.
No one argues -- we all agree there's a problem.
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?
I think none of these is the problem.
I don't mean they don't deserve attention.
We are a country of victims.
We were victims of the Spaniards.
Then we were victims of the French.
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.
Then we were victims of the PRI.
Hold on! Wait a minute!
What if none of these things is the problem?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of.
The problem is that we play the role of victims.
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.
Many people in Mexico are afraid today.
And we're acting out of that fear.
Does that make streets more or less safe?
We need to confront this fear.
For many people, acting involves rage.
We go from fear to rage.
They say, "I can't take it anymore.
Let's do something about it."
Usually it's one or two a year.
Now we're experiencing one every week.
We'll be waiting for you right here."
Of course, criminals can respond.
And in this case, they did.
But he keeps fighting.
He keeps organizing.
He keeps mobilizing.
And they're out there!
They just have to raise their hands.
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.
What are we going to do?
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.
Where is the soldier in each son?
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.
We're facing a very powerful opponent.
But we are many more.
They can take a man's life.
Anyone can kill me, or you, or you.
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans.
The battle is won, but we still have to fight it.
David Kelley on human-centered design
That was a really good time.
Lots of lives are being saved by those.
So, we really will continue to focus on products.
And it's a much better way to see.
Anyway, it's based on the London subway system.
The next video is not done by us.
Narrator: They took pictures.
We'll see what happens.
So you feel that in your cubicle.
But it was intended to be quite quiet.
You can see: there's the plant.
This product, it has two cameras.
He's made 30,000 new jobs.

John Lloyd inventories the invisible
So the question is, what is invisible?
There is more of it than you think, actually.
We can't see into the engine room.
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.
A photo is not enough."
That's what he thought he was there for.
Consciousness. I see all your faces.
Remind you of anyone?
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.
Two more than people, and the same as a gorilla.
The universe disappears.
The more light there is, the less you can see.
Time, nobody can see time.
It's much easier if it's not really there.
You can't see the future, obviously.
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"
Taste buds, every 10 days or so.
The question is, who, then, are we?
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.
Gas, you can't see that.
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.
But well done, him.
There is so many things that -- Light.
Electricity, you can't see that.
They don't. Nobody knows what it is.
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.
Radio waves. There's another thing.
And he said, "Well, I've no idea.
It is incredible how little we know.
The point, most of us. What's the point?
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
What the others are here for, I've no idea."
What we learned from 5 million books
And we cogitated about this for about four years.
And we came to a startling conclusion.
This is very, very low.
This is extremely practical, but not so awesome.
They have digitized millions of books.
That's very practical and extremely awesome.
Since time immemorial, there have been authors.
These authors have been striving to write books.
Now we've got the data, plus we have metadata.
We're going to try science."
Now we're thinking, what data can we release?
So take for instance "A gleam of happiness."
It's four words; we call that a four-gram.
What do they tell us?
Let me give you an example.
And so I might say, "Yesterday, I throve."
Well which one should I use?
Two rows from this table of two billion entries.
Now this is just two out of two billion rows.
For instance, this one.
In 1700, in 1800, in 1900, no one cared.
Through the 30s and 40s, no one cared.
People were walking around obsessed.
And just like that, the bubble burst.
We are losing interest in the past more rapidly.
JM: Now a little piece of career advice.
But guess what, nobody will really care.
Here's a simple way to do it.
So that's sort of what we expect.
And we compare that to the fame that we observe.
What you expect is basically what you observe.
ELA: So culturomics is what we call this method.
It's kind of like genomics.
Culturomics is similar.
Why can everyone do it?
We have to make this available for people."
There's various types of frustration.
If you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh."
Google has started to digitize 15 million books.
It's a sizable chunk of human culture.
Julian Treasure: 5 ways to listen better
We are losing our listening.
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this.
One of them is pattern recognition.
Differencing is another technique we use.
And then there is a whole range of filters.
But that's not all.
Sound places us in space and in time.
Why did I say that?
Well there are a lot of reasons for this.
In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody.
We're becoming impatient.
We're becoming desensitized.
This is not trivial.
Because listening is our access to understanding.
Conscious listening always creates understanding.
Would you like that?
The first one is silence.
Second, I call this the mixer.
How many birds am I hearing?
Where are they? Where are those ripples?
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.
Or just try this one on for size.
I call that the hidden choir.
It's around us all the time.
This is playing with those filters.
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.
And finally, an acronym.
You can use this in listening, in communication.
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.
That's too much to ask from most people.
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.
Thank you for listening to me today.
I'm going to talk all about that.
But this was, I have to admit, all an accident.
I thought the word framework was great.
And they said, oh, you don't need to do that.
And I said, I'll go in from the biological side.
So why should we have a good brain theory?
Well, there's lots of reasons people do science.
Why do we study ants? Well, it's interesting.
So why don't we have a good theory of brains?
And people have been working on it for 100 years.
This is normal science.
And it goes back and forth, you know?
What good is more going to do?
But, you know what? It's very, very regular.
Some people say, brains can't understand brains.
Very Zen-like. Whoo.
It's got a lot of cells in it too, right?
They all have a lot in common with brain science.
We're not smarter now than they were then.
Reality though, I call it real intelligence.
Real intelligence is built on something else.
It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
But it has all this complex behavior already.
Now, in evolution, what happened?
You do. It's your emotional brain.
So let me give you a few examples of predictions.
Now I could change your doorknob in other ways.
We don't do that. Your brain doesn't do that.
And that's because you're making a prediction.
Here's three visions of an object.
So what is the recipe for brain theory?
So what will brain theory look like?
It's also memory of sequences.
No doubt that it's going to happen, in my mind.
But they're very different types of memories.
So you're not going to see C-3PO.
We can also do intelligent security systems.
But ultimately, the world's the limit here.
I don't know how this is going to turn out.
Jody Williams: A realistic vision for world peace
I'm actually here to make a challenge to people.
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."
I think of meditation.
This is called human security.
And I'm trying harder and harder.
Mom, I'm really trying.
It is not arming our country to the teeth.
I certainly support the START vote.
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.
It is saving the tigers.
It is stopping the tar sands.
It is all of those things.
It is using our money for all of those things.
It is about action.
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.
Your robe gives it away."
I said, "That's good. That's good.
We need that in the world.
I don't follow that, but that's cool."
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.
I think what we need is action."
But I talked to her for a range of issues.
But I don't believe in hope without endeavor.
Here's another woman hero of mine.
She says the airports of the world.
Wangari Maathai -- 2004 Peace laureate.
Working for peace is very creative.
It's hard work every day.
Working together is what changes our world.
I'll tell you the quick story.
There was a mother and three children.
The children were killed on the spot.
It was Mairead's sister.
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.
She also received the Peace Prize.
She is now running for president.
They could maybe volunteer that much.
It's not a dirty word.
It's hard work every single day.

Hans Rosling and the magic washing machine
That was a great day for my mother.
And Grandma was even more excited.
Let me, let me push the button."
I want to see this! Give me a chair!
She was mesmerized.
Look, the homes are full of machines.
I can't even name them all.
And they consume more than $40 per day.
So two billion have access to washing machines.
And the remaining five billion, how do they wash?
Because it remains hard work for women to wash.
They wash like this: by hand.
And they want the washing machine.
And no one raised their hand.
This group uses three, one each.
And they also have electricity.
And over there they don't even use one each.
That makes 12 of them.
First, population growth.
Second, economic growth.
What will happen is economic growth.
"Wopp!" they will say.
And these people, they want the washing machine.
I told you. They'll go there.
And they will double their energy use.
So what needs to be done?
Of course they must be more energy-efficient.
They must change behavior in some way.
Here we can get more green energy all over.
This is what we hope may happen.
It's a real challenge in the future.
And what's the magic with them?
She said, "Now Hans, we have loaded the laundry.
The machine will make the work.
And now we can go to the library."
And mother got time to read for me.
And she also got books for herself.
And we really, we really loved this machine.
Thank you steel mill.
Thank you power station.

Erin McKean redefines the dictionary
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
And those bits are words.
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
Well, I blame the Queen.
Why do I blame the Queen?
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
Computers! What about computers?
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
They don't change the end result.
The design has not changed.
And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?
Online dictionaries must be different.
This is my favorite word, by the way.
Very useful word. So, look at that.
So there's not very much going on here.
There's not a lot of clickiness.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
We have a pan that's too small!
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
The English language is as big as it is.
Some of my best friends are books.
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
And I think this is a problem.
They're just the right tools for the job.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
You can ask for help!
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
There's a lot going on there.
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
Do you know what that says to me?
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
We're missing California from American English.
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
So again, lexicography is not rocket science.
It can't be that hard to find some words!
He's a director of an electroplating company.
He's found more than 140 comets.
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
What newspaper was it in? What book?
They use it synecdochically.
We can put in all the meanings.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
It wasn't really what people needed.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.

David Brooks: The social animal
But they have those social skills.
And he's going into a diner.
I was like, "Okay, that's social skill."
It would be a big seller.
You see them on the mountains up there.
And this leads to oddities.
Now I'm a middle-aged guy.
I'm not exactly comfortable with emotions.
It was just sheer terror.
It tells us what to imprint.
We're social animals, not rational animals.
We are now children of the French Enlightenment.
Babies come with this ability.
He wagged his tongue at the baby.
The baby wagged her tongue back.
They are what we call avoidantly attached.
They have trouble relating to other people.
So for example, we are overconfidence machines.
This is a gender-linked trait, by the way.
They have epistemological modesty.
They are open-minded in the face of ambiguity.
Then you could talk about a trait like blending.
It seems so elementary.
But this is the source of innovation.
That is what the unconscious mind hungers for.
The Greeks say we suffer our way to wisdom.
Sunitha Krishnan fights sex slavery
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
Shaheen's background I don't even know.
They are sold in the name of adoption.
They are sold in the name of organ trade.
And I tell you stories from there.
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
I never felt like a victim, then or now.
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
Where does their journey begin?
These people are deceived, forced.
Some pay the price for it.
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.
They are voiceless, [unclear], nameless people.
And we are silent about them.
We think it is easy money.
We think it is shortcut.
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
It's in that context that I work.
It's in that context that I rescue children.
And for me, I was my greatest experience.
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
Why welding and why not computers?
What has been my challenge?
I can't hear from my right ear.
My biggest challenge is society.
And there is a long pause.
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
That's my biggest challenge.
They need your compassion.
They need your empathy.
Can you break your culture of silence?
Can you just encompass these people too?
Because they are also a part of us.
They are also part of this world.
They died of AIDS last year.
Chris Anderson on TED's nonprofit transition
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.
And all this had come from nothing.
The date was February 2000.
And it was gut wrenching.
The theme next year is re-birth.
It's connected; it all hooks into each other.
And she answered, "A penis."
Are we the victims of a mass delusion?
And so on, and so on.
Every mental organ addressed. It really is.
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.
That's not going to be changed at all.
I think it will be great.
I'm incredibly excited about that.

Aparna Rao: High-tech art
And at the slightest sound, they hide back again.
So we had these panels on three walls of a room.
So this is how it works.
This is a video prototype.
And they don't react to background sounds.
So this is a very early prototype.
Of course, it got much better after that.
Soren enters the room. Pop! He goes invisible.
So this is a work called "The Sun Shadow."
And it's kind of constrained by that circle.
And there's no wires.
That's my colleague. He's let it go.
And it's at the scale of the night sky.
Debate: Does the world need nuclear energy?
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."
Those who are against, raise your hands.
Stewart Brand: Whoa.
Look at the client base for this.
That's where it is on all the time.
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.
Then what happens to the waste?
Wind is wonderful; I love wind.
I love being around these big wind generators.
They've run out of good sites.
The power lines are getting overloaded.
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
Solar's wonderful on rooftops.
We haven't even started the American stockpile.
This is one from Toshiba.
Typically, these things are put in the ground.
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.
And here's the future.
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.
And this is just the CO2 from the life cycle.
North Korea did that to some extent.
Iran is doing that right now.
So, do we need this?
The spacing is something else.
People confuse footprint with spacing.
Over the ocean, it's not even land.
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.
You can do that by combining renewables.
Here are the world wind resources.
So then here's the final ranking.
If you use wind, you guarantee ice will last.
If you're against, put up one.
And I want two of each for the mics.
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.
There's plenty of solar and wind.
That's from real data.
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.
CA: We need someone for.
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.
I've come around in the last 10 years.
I used to be against nuclear power.
CA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.
The first is: be aware of the propaganda.
Be very aware of the propaganda.
Secondly, think about this.
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.
Anyone else for? Go.
I've got solar PV on my roof.
However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.
Anyone else against?
I will also add one other thing.
CA: Point well made. Thank you.
Your final pitch, Stewart.
It was a sunny day and a windy night.
And just now in England they had a cold spell.
None of those things were stirring.
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.
This keeps happening.
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
And there's much more solar than there is wind.
CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.
So if you were in Palm Springs ...
Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.
All those in favor, raise your hands.
And all those against.
Now that is -- my take on that ...
Okay. So here's the read on it.
You both won. I congratulate both of you.
Thank you for that.
Francis Collins: We need better drugs -- now
So let me ask for a show of hands.
How many people here are over the age of 48?
Well, there do seem to be a few.
There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.
Now, that's the good news.
But there's still a lot of work to do.
So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.
Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?
Unfortunately, it's not.
There are no shiny bridges.
You sort of place your bets.
Well, what does this really look like?
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
Is it going to land where it's supposed to?
How can we make this go faster?
How can we make it more successful?
But it's taken a long time to get there.
That picture you see there?
Here it is. That's the same kid.
That's the good news.
How do we go faster?
I want to tell you about another disorder.
This one is a disorder which is quite rare.
Sam, please have a seat.
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.
This is a drug that was developed for cancer.
That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
Let me tell you another thing we could do.
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip.
You can see this chip even breathes.
It has an air channel. It has a blood channel.
Are those cells happy or not?
We are in a remarkable moment here.
I hope that's your goal.
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.
art,arts,creativity,education
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.
And we use the word "nothing."
This all started when I was age five.
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."
My world was seen as less.
I thought, I need to retreat into something else.
My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.
So you'd just see her feet.
So I was hiding in the shed, like that.
And all of a sudden ...
And then I saw her legs.
But I didn't get it.
So I'm sitting there thinking.
And I went into this little fantasy world.
Or do they need somewhere to live?"
And then I sat down and all the ants came along.
And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"
And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."
And from there I was watching this little world.
It became part of me.
My mother told me to take it smaller.
Now I shall show you something here.
As you can see, that's a pinhead.
Now that is called the Huf Haus.
So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"
And I says, "Well, try me."
Some of them were quite jagged.
Because that has happened to me.
I found these little bits of glass.
And I had to make them square.
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
And as I was doing it, what happened?
And it went like this ...
And then that was it.
And I decided to build it up.
And made the beams going around the house.
But I managed to do it.
And when I finished it, I came back the next day.
I noticed that the house was occupied.
Have we ever heard of a dust mite?
Darren dust mite and his family moved in.
So basically I'd completed the house.
There's not enough room for the two of them.
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
I think he was just warning him actually.
And, you know, all different things happen.
Then static electricity set in.
I experimented with a -- I found a dead fly.
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.
Decided to make a paintbrush.
But I would never do it to a living fly.
Because I've heard a fly in pain.
And they go "Meow! Ow!"
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
That was the paintbrush.
And it starts to dry very quickly.
So I have to be very quick.
So I have to be very very careful.
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."
As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.
I would say it probably measures ...
a quarter of a millimeter.
In America they say a period stop.
It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
And she saw me walking around like this.
And then she looked at me.
And then I went ...
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."
I had a 24-karat gold ring.
And I cut off a little flake of gold.
And the horse is made from nylon.
There's no way a man can do that.
It must be a machine."
That one took me approximately six weeks.
The most famous statue in the world.
This one, I would say, was a serious challenge.
Because I had to put the torch on the top.
And that's the first thing they saw.
So I wanted to have that little image.
And we all know that is the Hulk.
So I broke the needle.
And made a needle look like the Hulk's broken it.
So most of my work, I don't use glue.
They go in with their own friction.
And that's how I managed to do it.
That ship there, that's made from 24-karat gold.
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.
Constructed each plank of gold.
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
As you can see, dressage.
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.

Qatar is no exception to the region.
It's a very young nation led by young people.
Her answer was quite the contrary.
Not that you do; I'm just saying.
We know that modernization is happening.
And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.
It's important for us to grow organically.
I'm a representation of that phenomenon.
How does that impact our desert culture?
I want to ask you, why do you think this is?
No, I don't think so.
You know, art and culture is big business.
Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.
They make a lot of money.
We don't want to have what there is in the West.
We don't want their collections.
For me it was a new discovery.
And this is one of our filmmakers' products.
Who are you playing?
Girl: Uncle Khaled. Here, put on the headscarf.
Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?
Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.
Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad.
Play by yourself then.
Girl: Women! One word and they get upset.
Thank you. Thank you!
It's important for two things.
We should not underestimate it.
This is a very interesting journey.
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it.
Jane Goodall on what separates us from the apes
We want to know about health care.
And we want to learn other languages.
And so, coming directly from there to here.
A different way of life, a different being.
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
It's a very wuzzy line.
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
They have very sophisticated cooperation.
They know mental as well as physical suffering.
Didn't they know what was happening?
"How am I going to feed my family today?
So, this is a pretty grim picture.
Somebody said that yesterday.
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
Roots make a firm foundation.
Then, you see, it is a message of hope.
Every individual has a role to play.
We want to go and work in a dog shelter.
The philosophy is very simple.
We do not believe in violence.
No violence, no bombs, no guns.
That's not the way to solve problems.
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.
So how do we solve?
How many more minutes? Two, one?
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
Are you going to come and drag me off?
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
It's very encouraging.
And we've talked a lot about that.
Secondly, the resilience of nature.
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
Is it out there with the politicians?
It's really up to us.
We're the ones who can make a difference.
biology,chemistry,life,science
But it's very simple. It's very simplistic.
We consider first that life has a body.
Life also has a kind of inheritable information.
This is how we can start to make a protocell.
We use this idea called self-assembly.
Likewise, we can work with oil and water systems.
So that's just forming some body stuff, right?
Some architectures.
What about the other aspects of living systems?
This is natural from the environment, this clay.
It could run a metabolism on it.
So we're on a road towards living systems.
So, something is missing.
Some things are missing.
You add the droplet to the system.
So I add some food source to the system.
The protocell moves. It encounters the food.
We're going to make two different kinds.
That didn't happen before. There it goes.
There's a protocell AB now in this system.
But then something even more interesting happens.
Just with blobs of chemicals, again.
Think of it like a primordial ooze, okay?
But they have lifelike properties, is the point.
This is a term by Steve Benner.
Natalie Jeremijenko: The art of the eco-mindshift
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.
Mice are a very good representation.
This is one of them.
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.
Is anybody here on antidepressants?
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
What's the -- How did you know that? They did.
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
Where's our export?
Vodka, gin -- Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.
It's very different from the medical model.
This is a prescription to improve water quality.
That doesn't do a lot of good.
This is one of the more ambitious ones.
This was civic mobilization.
You understand a solar chimney.
Here's one of them that we have up now.
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.
They said things like this.
Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.
There's a good person.
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay.
So there was several of these.
These are just your average urban pigeon.
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
Do you know what slows it down?
That is, share your lunch.
NJ: It worked, and it's true.
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
This is what it looks like.
So there's another function on here.
And then you can also text the fish.
And they text back.
So updates from a beaver.
But they also have a chelating agent in them.

Larry Burns on the future of cars
People love their automobiles.
Songs are written about cars.
Prince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."
He wrote about a car.
And you say, boy, that's a lot.
That's just 12 percent of the population.
We wanted something that was really affordable.
First was Autonomy.
And Sequel truly is a real car.
So let me talk about hydrogen first.
And it can come from biofuels.
And that's quite exciting.
A lot of hydrogen's produced today in the world.
Now that's a lot of money.
So that's what we're driving to for 2010.
And we talked about swarm networks earlier.
We find that premise quite exciting.
I just want to ask one.
Larry Burns: Yeah, we're absolutely serious.
The substance of things unseen.
Cities, past and future.
So, Act I: A Map Found.
So, I didn't grow up in New York.
I started seeing paintings like this.
What's that palm tree doing there?
And it's this map you see here.
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
And this is City Hall Park.
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
This map was made for military reasons.
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.
But I had another idea about this map.
We can calculate the aspect.
And we might think of these as abandoned.
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.
Where do they get their food?
Where do they get their reproductive resources?
So we just started making a list.
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
But you can also talk about sunny places.
Or fire. Or dry soils.
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
And then we took this data.
You can see this for yourself on our website.
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.
And feed into that the map of the species.
So, how can we envision the city of the future?
Alex Steffen sees a sustainable future
Fill in the blanks.
So, you know, sustainability, small planet.
We're using up about five planets.
Clearly we don't have 10 planets.
We don't have that. So that's one problem.
And people simply do not have enough to survive.
A third of the people on this planet are kids.
And they may not want to live exactly like us.
I don't need to go into that.
We don't know how to do this yet.
So what's Worldchanging?
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?
You leave aside what is natural to be natural.
They've bounded the city with a line.
Nature, city. Nothing changes.
You can also start to change what you build.
You can start to know where things are.
When you share them, you end up using less.
We could just re-label things.
How we build things can change as well.
This is a bio-morphic building.
It takes its inspiration in form from life.
We're starting to cover this more and more.
It's every seven days.
So I rather like this picture here.
And those things lead to things like this.
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
Another world is possible.
We tweak that a lot.
How many people knew of Lula before today?
I would keep your eye on this fellow.
It's the greenest building in the world.
You get access to distance medicine.
Here's a way of transporting water.
I mean, that's a great design.
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
How do we help people like that?
New models for pedagogy for the displaced.
And we have new tools.
Does anyone know what this is?
Audience: It detects landmines.
You know, that it's not just enough to survive.
And I think that we will.
I hope that that turns out to be true.

Clay Shirky: Why SOPA is a bad idea
I'm going to start here.
And it's a copyright violation.
So there's two bills in Congress right now.
One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.
SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
It's from the Senate.
We don't really like to only consume.
That was the level of rhetoric.
And Congress did something.
But this taping business, fine, let it go.
But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.
So they went for plan B.
It took them a while to formulate plan B.
Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.
Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.
So PIPA and SOPA are round two.
So this is the Internet they have in mind.
That's the easy thing.
That's the simple thing.
And what they want is not to have to do that.
They just want the sharing to go away.
That's the way to handle this.
Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.

Bunker Roy: Learning from a barefoot movement
I'd like to take you to another world.
The whole world was laid out for me.
Everything was at my feet.
I could do nothing wrong.
It changed my life.
Mother went into a coma.
I mean, is there something wrong with you?"
I said, "No, I've got the best eduction.
"What do you want to do in a village?
No job, no money, no security, no prospect."
"Dig wells for five years?
I went to this village for the first time.
"You failed in your exam?"
"You didn't get a government job?" I said, "No."
"What are you doing here?
You have to work with your hands.
You have to have a dignity of labor.
Who is a professional?
A water diviner is a professional.
A traditional midwife is a professional.
A traditional bone setter is a professional.
These are professionals all over the world.
There are no contracts, no written contracts.
You can stay with me for 20 years, go tomorrow.
And no one can get more than $100 a month.
That is where we want you to try crazy ideas.
Whatever idea you have, come and try it.
It doesn't matter if you fail.
Battered, bruised, you start again.
You are certified by the community you serve.
So we built the first Barefoot College in 1986.
150 people lived there, worked there.
No water, rocky soil."
I was in a bit of a spot.
This is what it looks like today.
This is waterproofing the roof."
But it actually doesn't leak.
Since 1986, it hasn't leaked.
All the power comes from the sun.
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof.
It's a parabolic Scheffler solar cooker.
You'll never find Indian women so precise.
Very little water is wasted.
And what do we teach in these schools?
This is what we teach in the night schools.
But all the schools are solar-lit.
Every five years we have an election.
The prime minister is 12 years old.
First time ever going out of her village.
Wasn't dazzled at all by what was happening.
Puppets is the way we communicate.
You have Jokhim Chacha who is 300 years old.
He is my psychoanalyst. He is my teacher.
He's my doctor. He's my lawyer.
He actually raises money, solves my disputes.
He solves my problems in the village.
The attendance must not drop."
Went to Afghanistan.
So I took the husbands along.
In six months, how do we train these women?
You don't choose the written word.
You don't choose the spoken word.
You use sign language.
This woman is an extraordinary grandmother.
And they haven't collapsed.
We went to Africa, and we did the same thing.
But their body language is great.
"Where did they go?" "Went to India and back."
Went straight to the president.
"What's the story."
I said, "I can't, Mr. President.
But they will. The grandmothers will."
Went to this village.
I knew which woman I would like to take.
I said, "No, I want to take this woman."
"Difficult husband; not possible."
I said, "Yeah, she is very beautiful."
That was his biggest fear.
"Oh, somewhere. It doesn't matter."
Look for solutions within.
They're all over the world.
They have all the solutions in the world.
I'll end with a quotation by Mahatma Gandhi.

This first project is called the AlloBrain.
They're mining blood density levels.
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
You view the bond in the triangle.
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.
This is actually a light emitter.
This will be the final project that I show you.
Dan Gilbert asks, Why are we happy?
But evolutionarily, two million years is nothing.
Now -- -- all of you have done this.
And the other is becoming paraplegic.
So, just give it a moment of thought.
And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
But these aren't the data. I made these up!
Because happiness can be synthesized.
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.
Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it.
And here are three guys synthesizing happiness.
Who are these characters who are so damn happy?
Well, the first one is Jim Wright.
He lost his money; he lost his power.
What other way would there be to be better off?
And what did he have to say about his experience?
And he thought, "That's a really neat idea!"
Here it is, finally to be revealed.
Third: make somebody else really, really rich.
And finally: never ever join the Beatles.
What are these terms?
Why do we have that belief?
"Tell us how much you like them now."
What happens? Watch as happiness is synthesized.
You're watching happiness be synthesized.
Would you like to see it again? Happiness!
"The one I got is really better than I thought!
That other one I didn't get sucks!"
That's the synthesis of happiness.
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.
I'll take number three."
Back into the room, we say, "Hi, we're back."
If I've met you before, I don't remember."
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."
And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess.
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!
And I'm going to show you why.
Dilbert already knows, of course.
You're reading the cartoon as I'm talking.
"Dogbert's tech support. How may I abuse you?"
"Free? Aren't you just giving me my own paper?"
"What are you doing?"
You're married to a guy and he picks his nose?
You find a way to be happy with what's happened.
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.
They say, "I have to give one up?"
You get to keep one, and I get to keep one."
Now, there are two conditions in this experiment.
You will never see it again."
And look at what we find.
So here's the final piece of this experiment.
Is there really nothing good or bad?
They can't be exactly the same.
Steve Jurvetson on model rocketry
Baking soda and vinegar.
They use solid propellant most frequently.
It's a strange kind of love.
Mavericks: we had to call it Rocket Mavericks.
Here was a drag race.
Voices: Woohoo! Yeah. Nice.
They're yelling deploy. Voices: Oh shit.
Voices: It's going ballistic. Oh shit.
SJ: And I'll just be quiet.
Things often go wrong.
It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.

Carmen Agra Deedy spins stories
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
Then my pop got on there.
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
He was born there in 1924.
"After what I just told you?"
My whole life, my father's been there.
I love that, but we don't have the time.
Great story is the art of letting go.
So I'm going to tell you a little story.
Have you been watching the commercials?
There are stories you tell from stages.
I'm not telling you that story.
I'm telling you this one.
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
It's about human connection.
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
But this story only happened a few years ago.
It was a Saturday morning.
It's delicious. It's savory.
That kind of food, yeah.
This is the sensory part of the program, people.
I got an errand to run."
"You don't speak English?"
There's a historical marker.
Anybody? All right.
Rockports -- they're for this.
That's why they call them that.
This is her ensemble.
I show up. She's in the carport.
Of course, they have a carport.
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
"We taking your car?"
Blithering fucking idiots.
I said, "Is that thing real?"
"Can you even see?"
"You coming? You no coming?"
"Are you kidding me?"
"How are you doing it?"
"He's got to sleep sometime."
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
And there she goes, right.
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
"No, no, what you talking about?"
"Four or five days."
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
"I did not get a ticket."
"You weren't there, don't start."
"Come on. You got a ticket?"
"Ma, are you still doing that?"
"If it works, it works, baby.
"No, I look up, and the light, she change."
You should be terrified.
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
"You mean, like, in the car?"
"No, don't -- why are we here today?
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
"It will upset you."
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.
We're doing great. We're doing fine.
Well, I stood up to her.
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
You know, she eats small portions.
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
She wields great power.
Bless you, Dr. Watson.
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
I grew up with this woman.
"No, mama, you got to look."
I got to look. You got to look.
Don't you want to look?
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
Honey, sit up so they can see you."
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.
I think we all secretly love stories.
Come on, honey, tell it to me."
But in the South, we love a good story.
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
She is, after all, Cuban.
I pull in. I put the car in park.
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
"I'm not going anywhere."
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
I come out, and there's Esther.
She's hugging the purse.
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
"Ma, have you no shame?
People are watching us all around," right?
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.
Secret of the trade.
She says this to me.
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
She jumped out of that car."
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.
It's a half-whisper, "God, I miss her."
Neil Pasricha: The 3 A's of awesome
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
And they got here in the late 1960s.
We grew up, and we grew older.
I went to high school.
Life was pretty good.
2006 was a great year.
2007 was a great year.
2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
First of all, the news was so heavy.
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
Very sadly, he took his own life.
And it was a really heavy time.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
I was like, that sounds totally fake.
So let's talk about those three As.
They are Attitude, Awareness and Authenticity.
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.
The second "A" is Awareness.
I love hanging out with three year-olds.
Because you all used to be three years old.
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
The last "A" is Authenticity.
He's number 76 in the picture.
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."
But Rosey Grier also had another passion.
That's what he said.
It's a great cover.
You meet people that you like talking to.
You go places you've dreamt about.
So those are the three A's.
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
I was eating olives with pie.
They've got an apple here from South Africa.
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.
There are so many things to be happy about.
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
You can sleep in clean sheets.
You can go to the movies and get good seats.
And that's the sad part.
You will never be as young as you are right now.
Ellen 't Hoen: Pool medical patents, save lives
They were not the only ones.
So there was a bit of a conflict there.
So what has this got to do with this?
He was told that a cure did not exist.
AIDS had become a chronic disease.
In 2002, they were facing a different battle.
Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.
Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.
People who have access to these drugs stop dying.
And there's something else.
They also stop passing on the virus.
Well, things have changed.
First of all, the rules have changed.
So what India did is no longer possible.
This shows you a patent landscape.
This is the landscape of one medicine.
Again, deliberate action is needed.
That can be generic manufacturers.
They were forced to do so.
Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
He has access to antiretroviral drugs.
His son will soon be 14 years old.
And this is no longer fantasy.
Already, I'll give you an example.
This has never been done before.
This has never been seen before.

Sunni Brown: Doodlers, unite!
So I just want to tell you my story.
So I discovered some very interesting things.
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.
And I'm not comfortable with that.
So here's a new definition for doodling.
That is why millions of people doodle.
And I think that is incredible.
And I will go you one further.
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.

I'll just say, July.
Zzzzzzip for safety.
Water wings -- an inch of water.
So you can get kind of a feel for this.
So my baby, Vander, is eight years old now.
He's interested in playing football.
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.
So why would I worry?
Because this is what I do. This is what I teach.
It's what I study. It's what I treat.
And I know that kids get concussed every year.
All right. "Starsky and Hutch," arguably, yes.
In case you missed it, we'll look again.
So look to the right-hand side of the screen.
What would you say?
Would it be crazy to know, 103 Gs.
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs.
Because I know our brains are resilient.
They're designed to recover from an injury.
But kids are more vulnerable to brain injury.
So how do we guarantee the safety of our kids?
Let me tell you what I've come up with.
She's totally not kidding."
Should your kid play football? I don't know.
But I do know there are three things you can do.
The first: study up.
There are some great resources out there.
The CDC has a program, Heads Up.
Heads Up is specific to concussion in kids.
The second thing is: speak up.
Speak up also with coaching staff.
What's the budget for protective equipment?
So, should Vander play football?

Why are we embedded in social networks?
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?
And how do they effect us?
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.
But the visual complexity is still very high.
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?
And, most importantly, what causes the clusters?
On the far left, you see the purple line.
Well, what might be causing this clustering?
Blame your fat friends."
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.
So, again, every dot is a person.
Every tie between them is a relationship.
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.
Now, when we have emotions, we show them.
Why do we show our emotions?
But we don't just experience them, we show them.
But they never look like this.
Why do they not look like this?
But that's not the case with real networks.
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.
That's very obvious, we all know that.
This is known as transitivity in networks.
they would say, "I've got six friends.
That's my social experience."
Would you rather be C or D?
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.
Now, you would rather be C.
But we also found some non-obvious things.
Now, what is the point of this?
How does this help us understand?
They are a kind of social capital.
So think about these two common objects.
aging,culture,science
Laura Carstensen: Older people are happier
You hear about it all the time.
You read about it in your newspapers.
You hear about it on your television sets.
It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
That's right, older people are happy.
And stress, worry, anger all decrease with age.
After all, aging is not a piece of cake.
Originally the sample was aged 18 to 94.
How sad are you right now?
And there is a slight downturn.
But that's not the case.
So how can this be?
We might learn something unexpected.
We go on blind dates.
People over 50 don't go on blind dates.
We take less notice of trivial matters.
The numbers won't determine the outcome.

Aaron Huey: America's native prisoners of war
So take a look around this auditorium today.
I'll begin in 1824.
The treaties were out the window.
I want to repeat that part.
The Lakota defeat the U.S. army.
Also in 1871, we ended the time of treaty-making.
He was later killed while in custody.
That clause was obviously ignored.
1887: The Dawes Act.
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends.
Tribes lost millions of acres.
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu.
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
They were tired of treaties.
They were tired of sacred hills.
They were tired of ghost dances.
So they brought out their cannons.
School dropout rate is up to 70 percent.
They're killing each other.
This is how we came to own these United States.
This is the legacy of manifest destiny.
Is any of this your responsibility today?
There must be some call to action.
So where does that leave us?
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?
Give back the Black Hills.
It's not your business what they do with them.
So, I hope I can really accomplish that.
That's why there's a glass of water up there.
For us, it's a problem, the people in this room.
For babies, it's deadly.
Now, the solution turned out to be simple.
And what it was was oral rehydration salts.
Many of you have probably used this.
Remarkable impact on mortality.
Massive solution to the problem.
Still a big number, but a big drop.
What's going on here?
That's actually not true.
Maybe there's a biological answer.
Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy.
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.
It's not even unique to poor people in India.
Here's an example from a variety of contexts.
I've put a bunch of examples up here.
OK, the American population.
It's not just medicine.
This is the last mile.
The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.
Alright, what's the problem?
They do lots of inconsistent things.
That's complex, but it's manageable.
When we're dealing with people like this?
The mind is more complex.
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.
In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."
Think about what that means for a second.
I don't think that's stupid.
Just doesn't make sense.
Now, the model is intuitively right.
It's more complex than that.
A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.
How much does the ball cost? Quick.
So, somebody out there says, "Five."
A lot of you said, "Ten."
Let's think about 10 for a second.
If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...
this is easy, $1.10.
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.
So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.
Most of you look smart.
How is that possible? Let's go to something else.
I know algebra can be complicated.
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?
I think we've learned the answer to that here.
I just want you to name the color of the object.
That's all it is. OK?
Audience: Red. Green.
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.
Almost out of kindergarten.
What is all this telling us?
Now, I do this stuff because it's fun.
But it's more profound than fun.
BMW is a pretty safe car.
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?
Here's another puzzle for all of you.
See, you have a mental model.
Miles per gallon is the way we present things.
Researchers have found these type of anomalies.
Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?
The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.
They showed a BMW driving down the street.
It harnesses something you already believe.
So, let me now talk about the last mile problem.
So far, I've been pretty negative.
And I think maybe I'm being too negative.
Maybe it's the diarrhea.
Let's go back to diabetes.
This is a typical insulin injection.
Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.
Here is an innovation, a design innovation.
The needle is particularly sharp.
You just gotta carry this thing around.
It's much easier to use, much less painful.
Here's another example of this.
This is from a company called Positive Energy.
This is about energy efficiency.
"You're doing worse." Frown.
So, how do we tackle the last mile?
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.
But you know what we need to combine it with?
But you know what we do on the last mile?
The amount of resources we put in are disparate.
We're on the verge of a whole new social science.
All right. Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.
So, this whole area is so fascinating.
Because they've seen it on the ground.
Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.
Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.
So, there is a little bit of slippage there.
art,design,education,happiness,humor,work
Stefan Sagmeister on what he has learned
They were combined in the media.
We're doing changing media.
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.
We do them for our clients.
They are commissioned.
"Worrying solves nothing."
The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.
It said, "Money does does make me happy."
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.
Singapore was quite in discussion.
And the very last one is a billboard.
We let that lie around in the sun.
education,science,technology
I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.
But you have to have the right tools.
You see that really salty Play-Doh?
Well, it conducts electricity.
And this is nothing new.
And that sugar dough?
So what does that mean?
And so I want to do a little demo for you.
If I push these together, the light turns off.
If I separate them again, I have some light.
It's like a wall to the electricity.
I plug in again the power to it.
I can start plugging in lots of lights.
So this is all in your home kitchen.
Have fun. Thank you.
Benjamin Zander on music and passion
And one of them wrote, "Situation hopeless. Stop.
They don't wear shoes."
And the other one wrote, "Glorious opportunity.
They don't have any shoes yet."
Maybe you have this child at home.
He sounds something like this.
I see some of you recognize this child.
At that point, they usually give up.
And the second, with an impulse every other note.
You can see it by looking at my head.
And the 10-year-old, on every eight notes.
It can be the other buttock.
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio.
You should be a one-buttock player."
And suddenly, the music took off. It took flight.
And then I got a letter from this gentleman.
He said, "I was so moved.
There are 1,600 people, I believe.
And your children are playing instruments.
That's the first group; it's quite a small group.
Then there's another group, bigger group.
That's the second group.
Now comes the third group.
It's just simply not part of your life.
That's probably the largest group of all.
And then there's a very small group.
These are the people who think they're tone-deaf.
Amazing number of people think they're tone-deaf.
So nobody is tone-deaf.
The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.
So that's what we're going to do.
Of course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it."
So let's see what's really going on here.
We have a B. This is a B. The next note is a C.
But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.
Now, it goes down to A. Now to G. And then to F.
Let's try it again. Ooh, the TED choir.
Or they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex."
No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.
So he does it again.
Now, he tries E again. That chord doesn't work.
Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.
And then finally ...
So this is a piece which goes from away to home.
And finally goes to E, and it's home.
What was he thinking about? Lunch?
I was clapping. They were clapping.
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"
Now that is something.
But I tell you what happened to me.
And I felt the tears streaming down my face.
How would you talk? How would you be?
See, these are totally different worlds.
We can do that with our children, too.
That's a totally different world.
And you know, I have a definition of success.
Shining eyes, shining eyes.
Thank you, thank you.

Tom Shannon's anti-gravity sculpture
So, it can balance on a point.
The aluminum is because it's very light.
So it allows it to roll.
And I thought up a lot of ideas.
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
I think we could roll the tape, admin.
And here is a similar sculpture.
That's the Sun at that end.
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon.
This is a little stone ball, floating.
And so this is the size of the Sun.
This is in Sapporo.
So you can see it rotating here.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
This is another species of work that I do.
This is based on the structure of a diamond.
These were white spheres.
This is a clock I designed.
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.
So if we could roll the next film here.
I came with a plan.
This is the control room inside of the ship.
It's like a traveling show.
Here the legs are retracting.
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
It weighs about 20 tons.
It has on-board generators.
It's completely silent and nonpolluting.
So it could land in a park, for example.
Or this could represent a college green.
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
So that's pretty much it.
Dan Pink on the surprising science of motivation
I need to make a confession at the outset here.
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.
I don't want to tell you a story.
I want to make a case.
This is called the candle problem.
Some of you might have seen this before.
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.
This shows the power of incentives.
Here's what he did. He gathered his participants.
To the second group he offered rewards.
It's a nice motivator.
That's not how it's supposed to work. Right?
Bonuses, commissions, their own reality show.
Incentivize them. That's how business works.
But that's not happening here.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.
Let me show you what I mean.
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.
You: we're incentivizing.
What happened this time?
You want to be looking around.
Let me tell you why this is so important.
Software can do it faster.
Think about your own work.
The rules are mystifying.
Now, I mean it makes me crazy.
And this is not -- here's the thing.
This is not a feeling.
Okay? I'm a lawyer; I don't believe in feelings.
This is not a philosophy.
I'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy.
Let me give you an example of what I mean.
Lets go to Madurai, India and test this."
Standard of living is lower.
And do you know who sponsored this research?
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.
That's the American experience.
We need a whole new approach.
Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.
I want to talk today only about autonomy.
Management did not emanate from nature.
Okay? Somebody invented it.
And it doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
Management is great.
Let me give you some examples.
It looks like less than half.
Atlassian is an Australian software company.
And they do something incredibly cool.
Work on anything you want."
They call them FedEx Days.
Okay? Radical amounts of autonomy.
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.
They show up when they want.
They just have to get their work done.
And I say, "Nope. I have proof."
Different model, right?
Do it because you like to do it.
If they went head to head, who would win?"
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation. Right?
This is the Thrilla' in Manila.
And here is what science knows.
The drive to do things cause they matter.
And here's the best part. Here's the best part.
business,leadership,music,psychology,society
Itay Talgam: Lead like the great conductors
And I go on the podium.
You know, this little office of the conductor.
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
Noise becomes music.
Let's look at the first video.
So that was a sort of a success.
Now, who should we thank for the success?
They don't often even look at the conductor.
In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."
So that's a sort of a tradition.
But Viennese audiences do not do that.
And I often show this to senior management.
People get annoyed.
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"
And then you have other stories, unseen.
People who build this wonderful concert hall.
This is the true experience of a live concert.
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?
And not all conductors do just that.
Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.
Riccardo Muti, please.
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
So please, wait for the conductor.
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...
He says, "I'm responsible."
Responsible in front of him.
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."
And you know what happened to Muti?
"Why? Because you don't let us develop.
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?
He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.
What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.
Did you see the hands?
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...
Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
Audience: Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.
Audience: Itay Talgam: Why not together?
Because you didn't know when to play.
But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.
This is a German orchestra, yes?
"Do you understand what this guy wants?"
Now that's great. What about the eyes?
Why are the eyes closed?
And he cues in a flute player like this.
The guy has no idea what to do.
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.
That is another story.
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?
That's what he does.
And that's what makes them into partners.
You have the plan in your head.
But here and there and that. You know what to do.
This is very exciting for those players.
It is very tiring. Yeah?
But it's the best music making, like this.
You also have to be very professional.
And look again at this Kleiber.
Can we have the next video, quickly?
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.
Again you see the beautiful body language.
Go along with the video. Look.
See, second time for the same player.
And now the third time for the same player.
"Wait for me after the concert.
I have a short notice to give you."
He's conducting Mozart.
The whole orchestra is playing.
Now something else.
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
Okay. You see that?
So that's a good thing.
You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
So Kleiber is about process.
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.
Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
Did you see Lenny's face?
And you're playing a painful sound.
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
But not in a way that you want to stop.
But you can see the music on his face.
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?
Rob Hopkins: Transition to a world without oil
Like all stories, it has a beginning.
This is a liter of oil.
And that gap continues to widen.
Completely unprecedented, historically.
Already that's fallen to about 11.
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
This is a popular story in some places.
But the world isn't Second Life.
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.
Energy and technology are not the same thing.
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.
It's sensitive to place and to scale.
Transitional is completely different.
It learns very much from its mistakes.
And it's a process which is really joyful.
So how does this transition idea work?
They show films, they give talks, and so on.
And we see it all over the place as well now.
Because I think stories are vital here.
Well, this is about state budgets.
The understanding is very low.
Here's the overall picture.
U.S. economy is big -- 14.7 trillion.
But we're spending 36 percent.
Well what are we taking in?
Simple business question.
Answer is 26 percent.
In fact, this is the forecast picture.
This is what you see at this overall level.
Now how did we get here?
How could you have a problem like this?
So you get a big squeeze.
Well, some really nice little tricks.
And these were somewhat noticed.
The paper said, "It's not really balanced.
It perpetuates deficit spending.
It's riddled with gimmicks."
This is so blatant, so extreme.
They sell off the assets.
They defer the payments.
They sell off the revenues from tobacco.
And California's not unique.
So it's systemic across the entire country.
This is the retiree health care benefits.
Well what's going to give?
So far it's meant layoffs, increased class sizes.
Technology has a role to play.
That's something I think is very, very important.
Where's the brain trust that's in error here?
Well there really is no brain trust.
Just look at this spending.
Everybody has an opinion.
There's great feedback.
And the numbers are used to make decisions.
We need better tools.
We can get some things out on the Internet.
We need better accounting.
It should be more like private accounting.
It's the gold standard.
But in fact, their work was sort of pushed off.
So we need these pieces.
Now I think this is a solvable problem.
It's a great country with lots of people.
arts,creativity,writing
Young-ha Kim: Be an artist, right now!
Don't they just pop into your head?
Well you might have, but I don't think so.
This is the theme of my talk today.
We are all born artists.
If you have kids, you know what I mean.
Almost everything kids do is art.
They draw with crayons on the wall.
But you shouldn't worry.
They are talking about things they didn't see.
It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.
Parents should celebrate.
"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"
All right! It calls for celebration.
Soon, a story develops.
In essence, they are not different.
He merely connected one sentence after another.
And you continue to make connections.
Kafka did not show his work to his father.
He was not on good terms with his father.
On his own, he wrote these sentences.
They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
In other words, it's useless.
But kids don't mind.
Kids don't do it because someone told them to.
They talk about these kinds of experiences.
You must have had such a moment.
It's a bit mischievous, actually.
We can play all night long.
Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
Of course, there were kids who had to.
You know this gentleman, right?
"I'm drawing diligently," I said.
"Why are you using only black?"
"You'll get it!" he said.
But such a teacher is seldom found.
Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
They get locked in.
That's our tragedy.
Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
Some people turn into rockers like this.
Or some people dance in clubs.
So we start to envy them.
We easily say these sorts of things.
That's what I think.
What should we do then?
Right now, we need to start our own art.
In this course, all students must put on a play.
However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
It will say a lot of things.
You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
The students go into a kind of trance.
And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
Why we cannot be something is not important.
Mostly, they have the faces of our parents.
They are devils. Devils.
And they have a magic question.
The magic question is, "What for?"
But art is not for anything.
Art is the ultimate goal.
It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
So I asked the driver, "What is this?"
He proudly said he played King Lear.
That's the world I dream of.
Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"
In 1990, she was asked this question.
And here's what she answered: "Just do it."
Wow. I was touched.
So what should we do now?
Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
climate change,environment,global issues,science
And what would you do if you knew what I know?
Let's start with how I got to this point.
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere?
Or was Venus extremely hot?
Its changes will affect all of humanity.
But there were consequences.
So the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance.
Is there more energy coming in than going out?
If so, more warming is in the pipeline.
Now consider Earth's climate history.
But that lag is exactly what is expected.
And more CO2 causes more warming.
The physics does not change.
What sea level rise can we look forward to?
Where you are sitting now would be under water.
There would be no stable shoreline.
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable.
Global warming is already affecting people.
More grandchildren helped me along.
Jake is a super-positive, enthusiastic boy.
Does not enlarge government.
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices.
Sounds like a conservative climate plan."
That is the equivalent of what we face now.
But we aren't even starting.
Clearly, I haven't gotten this message across.
The science is clear.
We owe it to our children and grandchildren.

Steve Truglia: A leap from the edge of space
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.
A parachute jump from the very edge of space.
More about that a bit later on.
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.
They had no safety, no real technology.
What safety they had was very scant.
You can see from the slide, very very strong.
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.
We couldn't do them without technology.
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.
Being run over is never easy.
And testing breakaway signpost pillars.
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.
They did it by remote control.
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.
It's a great job, really.
And people are looking like this ...
A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.
Only one person had ever done it before.
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."
Well, you'd die if you did that.
High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.
That's all it is, a bouncy castle.
Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.
This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.
We fly people on wires, like this.
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.
And that's Centre Point in London.
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.
Project Excelsior, it was called.
There were three jumps.
They first dropped some dummies.
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.
So it's an extremely hostile place to be.
This is Joe Kittenger himself.
Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
He's a very humble and wonderful human being.
This is him in a pressure suit.
You need a pressure suit.
Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.
Not even a jet engine.
I've found that team in America now.
And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.
They're just so, so delicate.
And what must that feel like?
You can just see them there, popping open.
I did quite a lot of research.
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
That's in New Mexico.
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.
My gondola will be more simple than that.
It's a three sided box, basically.
So I've had to do quite a lot of training.
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.
If you're at 100,000 feet you die.
The body swells up. It's awful.
And so we expect -- it's not much fun.
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.
I'm confident that we'll find one.
I think it's a great challenge.
Thank you very much for your time.
Ken Robinson says schools kill creativity
I've been blown away by the whole thing.
In fact, I'm leaving.
Don't you? I find this very interesting.
Like religion, and money and other things.
And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.
Thank you. That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much. So, 15 minutes left.
Well, I was born ... no.
And the girl said, "They will in a minute."
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story? No, it was big.
It was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel.
We considered this to be one of the lead parts.
They just switched, that was it.
And the second boy said, "I bring you myrhh."
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."
If they don't know, they'll have a go.
They have become frightened of being wrong.
And we run our companies like this, by the way.
In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles.
My son didn't want to come.
I've got two kids. He's 21 now; my daughter's 16.
He'd known her for a month.
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.
You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't.
Everywhere on Earth.
Why not? I think this is rather important.
I think math is very important, but so is dance.
And slightly to one side.
They're the people who come out the top.
And I used to be one, so there.
They live up there, and slightly to one side.
It's a way of getting their head to meetings.
And there's a reason.
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.
And I think we can't afford to go on that way.
And I didn't want one, frankly.
It's a process of academic inflation.
We know three things about intelligence.
We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
The brain isn't divided into compartments.
Because you are, aren't you?
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
It wasn't an available condition.
People weren't aware they could have that.
Take her to a dance school."
I said, "What happened?"
And for the future, it won't serve us.
This talk is about righting writing wrongs.
And wherever they went, they killed.
Now, I had friends in the U.S.
who had started a successful new tribe.
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.
I had four phases to this plan.
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.
Here's how the dots connected.
and ideas du bon marche.
Let's just say "value for money."
And one more thing: No, don't F it up."
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.
Now, were the Axis successful?
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
So everywhere we went, we auditioned amateurs.
We filmed that process and aired a documentary.
I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."
It really is his name.
20 years ago, no one had heard of it.
We've started in our region.

Shukla Bose: Teaching one child at a time
And I'm not a trained academic.
Neither am I a veteran social worker.
How many children will you get?
How are you going to scale?
How are you going to replicate?"
So, we started Parikrma.
Indian academic year begins in June.
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.
No one in their family has spoken English.
No one in their generation has spoken English.
But how wrong it is.
They'll never be able to cope."
That's absolute hogwash.
Fathers have started to attend.
Now they have started writing their signature.
The children have taught them.
It's amazing how much children can teach.
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.
I mingled with almost everyone.
They were very friendly.
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.
My accent with English improved a lot.
And today she wants to be a neurologist.
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.
They are really excelling.
We also have our very own dream team.
Why is this happening? Why this confidence?
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.
This is five-year-old Parusharam.
He's in kindergarten.
He has learned how to speak English.
I like eating. I like playing."
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.
But today I have been transformed.
I have been changed with my children.
Malcolm Gladwell on spaghetti sauce
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
It's a mess. It's all over the place.
Howard is not so easily placated.
This was an enormous revelation.
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."
And they would say, you know, "Move! Next!"
And that's where we got zesty pickles.
That's called "adherence."
So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.
So he said, this is what I want to do.
And then he analyzed the data.
Now why is that important?
People don't know what they want! Right?
What do you like? Dark, rich, hearty roast!
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.
So that's number one thing that Howard did.
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon. Right?
Takes over the mustard business!
A better mustard! A more expensive mustard!
And Howard looked to that and said, that's wrong!
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
What do I mean by that?
This is the way it ought to be.
And where did that come from? It came from Italy.
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.
They were looking for one way to treat all of us.
But that changed, right?
I guess my cancer different from your cancer.
And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.
And the example he used was coffee.

Ivan Oransky: Are we over-medicalized?
We also refer to subclinical conditions.
One of my favorites is called subclinical acne.
In baseball, the game follows the pre-game.
Season follows the pre-season.
We've medicalized everything in this country.
Strike one is when you hit puberty.
That's been medicalized as well.
Strike three is menopause.
So, just take a moment.
It's called pre-death.
I made up pre-death.
I didn't make up pre-vivor.
You are a pre-vivor.
If you develop a disease, you're off the island.
That's not very good for doctors' business.
We are all responsible.
But everyone is responsible.
We have this system where that's what you do.
And that's actually true.
But, you know, there are ways out.
So that's, to me, a way forward.
Billy Beane, by the way, learned the same thing.
Scott McCloud on comics
I thought this was a little strange at the time.
I played a lot of chess.
So, he has four kids, right?
The funny thing is, Dad had a lot of faith in me.
But there's a middle ground, too.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
So, three types of vision, right?
So what does a "scientific mind" do in the arts?
Sequence is a very important aspect of comics.
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
This was even before the Web.
Interactivity was another thing.
There were hypertext comics.
Parallel narratives could be literally parallel.
I'm going to show you a couple now.
And notice what's going on here.
I just want to get to the last panel.
Talk about your infinite canvas.
Why is this important?
And that's why I think this is important.
One of many reasons, but I've got to go now.
Thank you for having me.
Caroline Lavelle casts a spell on cello
Now, I've got a story for you.
And I said, "Do you really?"
This song is called "Farther than the Sun."
Chris Bliss: Comedy is translation
And it's a charming read.
So no ego problems.
I don't need a husband who wants to be."
And that's when I discovered comedy.
His intent is to be funny.
Now let me give you an example from my act.
Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.
Why is this remotely controversial?
You have given birth to an abomination.
Remove it from your household.
That's an entire childhood in three words.
So we started talking about climate change.
You've got to love that idea.
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.
And it didn't stop there.
That is a lot of punch for 14 words.

That's a little diver up there in the corner.

And how do you do that?
How do you get insight?
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
We'd love to tag in Monterey.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
And that's kind of their home range.
So that's a very important piece of data.
They're super industrious.

Most importantly for this, they're faster.

Mallika Sarabhai: Dance to change the world
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
Just then, with a loud bang, the heavens opened.
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.
The woman paid him no heed.
Then Indra disappeared.
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.
He realized at once what had happened.
So, the god Vishnu arrived.
"Are there any witnesses?"
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.
Vishnu gave his judgment.
May he be called to wash away his sins."
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India there is a rape every three minutes.
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
And it's not only about women.
Look around you, look at your own countries.
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.
There is a trend here.
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
No. It breaks through those.
For me it came very early.
So, what do they do?
So what do you do? Do you let them die?
Well, somebody had a great idea.
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
Man: You know how expensive those are.
Woman: What solution?
Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.
Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.
Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.
Woman: Here father. Woman: Yes, of course.
Woman: All right, father.
Man: And you, you count that she does it right.
Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.
All the germs from the water we take.
Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
Man: So this is the cotton sari.
And through this we will have clean water.
Well, here is one such way.
You are peaceful people.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.

Can I have my last audio track please?
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."
But the princess continued whistling.
But the king had an idea.
He announced a Swayamvara.
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"Now what shall we do?" said the king.
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?
"Uh-huh ..." she said.
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."
George Dyson at the birth of the computer
This was a perfect introduction.
And it was a technology that was inevitable.
He said you needed addition and subtraction.
You could do the whole thing with addition.
And that's really the simplest computer.
That's where I grew up as a kid.
That's Freeman, a long time ago, and that was me.
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.
They didn't fit in at the Institute.
You can read the text.
These were not theoretical physicists.
All the computers now are copies of that machine.
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.
This includes a large amount of human error.
What's code, what's hardware?
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.
"No use, went home."
Burning lots of midnight oil.
"Aha!" So, they figured out it's a code problem.
"Found trouble in code, I hope."
"Code error, machine not guilty."
"And the dawn came." So they ran all night.
"Master control off. The hell with it. Way off."
"A short -- do not turn the machine on."
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.
"I have now duplicated both results.
This now is the third different output.
I know when I'm licked."
"We've duplicated errors before."
"Machine run, fine. Code isn't."
"Only happens when the machine is running."
And sometimes things are okay.
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.
He had a wonderful rapport.
Even errors were duplicated.
So he designed this universe, and ran it.
It was published in the literature.
This is some of the generations of his universe.
They have to have something.
And they did start to evolve.
And he went around the country after that.
And could you do it again now?
And it was his universe on punch cards.
And the question is, should we run them or not?
You know, could we get them running?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?
And that's what's happening!
It's a world that Von Neumann himself envisioned.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
And that's the end.

Misha Glenny: Hire the hackers!
We are everyone. We are no one.
We are anonymous. We are legion.
We do not forgive. We do not forget.
We are but the base of chaos.
And they're pretty scary.
But interestingly, they have a sense of humor.
"What do we do now?
being a victim of hacking for a change.
Is nothing sacred anymore, for heaven's sake?
And their politics are not entirely unattractive.
Okay, they're a little inchoate.
Now this is a very complicated struggle.
And I sort of get it.
They're completely anonymous, as it were.
And so nothing is going into the hackers.
But I think they're doing very important work.
But what about the real cybercriminals?
Now CarderPlanet was very interesting.
And after that, it just went wild.
And he did a great job in it.
His slide into criminality was incremental.
Born in Meridian, Idaho.
One of the smartest people I've ever met.

My name's Jamie Oliver. I'm 34 years old.
I use information, education.
We have an awful, awful reality right now.
America, you're at the top of your game.
Please put your hands up.
Look at homicide at the bottom, for God's sake.
Any doctor, any specialist will tell you that.
This is a global problem.
It's a catastrophe.
It's sweeping the world.
England is right behind you, as usual.
I know they were close, but not that close.
We need a revolution.
Think about smoking.
It costs way less than obesity now.
We need it. The time is now.
We're in a tipping-point moment.
I've been doing this for seven years.
I've been trying in America for seven years.
I went to the eye of the storm.
Or it was last year.
Huntington, West Virginia.
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany.
She's 16 years old.
She has six years to live.
She's eating her liver to death.
Stacy, the Edwards family.
This is a normal family, guys.
The family's obese.
Justin here, 12 years old, he's 350 pounds.
He gets bullied, for God's sake.
The daughter there, Katie, she's four years old.
Marissa, she's all right, she's one of your lot.
He's at the sharp knife-edge of this problem.
He has to bury the people, OK?
Come winter, three times as many people die.
This is preventable disease. Waste of life.
By the way, this is what they get buried in.
We're not geared up to do this.
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?
This is our landscape of food.
I need you to understand it.
Let's be frank and honest: Well, modern-day life.
Let's start with the Main Street.
Supermarkets as well.
Big companies. Big companies.
Labeling is a massive problem.
The labeling in this country is a disgrace.
The industry wants to self-police themselves.
That ain't happening anymore.
Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.
How are you feeling?
But I'm killing them.
JO: Yes you are. You are.
But we can stop that.
I'm not slacking them off.
They're doing the best they can do.
They're doing their best.
Knives and forks? No, they're too dangerous.
We're not teaching our kids.
We don't teach kids about food. Right?
Video: Who knows what this is?
Do you know what that is?
Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli?
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.
Do you know what this is, honey? Child: Celery.
I want to talk about something so basic as milk.
Every kid has the right to milk at school.
They'll be having two bottles. OK?
But milk ain't good enough anymore.
And obviously now that's going to catch on.
Do you know what I mean?
For me, there ain't no need to flavor the milk.
Okay? There's sugar in everything.
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients.
There's our milk. There's our carton.
So, let me just show you.
You know, there's your week.
There's your month.
This, all this bad news, is preventable.
It's very, very preventable.
Okay so, in my world, what do we need to do?
Where else do you shop so religiously?
This is not expensive.
I know, easier said than done.
It's the future. It's the only way.
I know how they do it.
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.
The workplace, we haven't really talked about it.
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.
Let's go back to the home.
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.
We've got to put back what's been lost.
I truly believe that change will happen.
Huntington's Kitchen. I work with a community.
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?
You know, it's local cooks teaching local people.
It's incredibly important.
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.
Eve Ensler: happiness in body and soul
I bet you're worried.
I was worried. That's why I began this piece.
I was worried about my own vagina.
She was busy; she didn't have time.
Once they got going, you couldn't stop them.
Mainly because no one's ever asked them before.
"Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina."
You need to air out your pussy-cat."
I am worried about vaginas.
This is how the "Vagina Monologues" begins.
There're three qualities I want to talk about.
I have met these women everywhere on the planet.
And this is a very heady place.
Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.
I was beaten by my husband for five years.
He almost murdered me. I left and you can too."
Ben Dunlap talks about a passionate life
But there it is: "Yo napot, pacak!"
So, how do I explain this mysterious affinity?
So, "Yo napot, pacak!"
His name was Sandor Teszler.
He built one plant after another.
He will not steal from us again."
And then resumed the beating.
"No, I reckon I don't."
Do you have any other questions?"
Whenever you hear this, I will be there."
And now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.
"Yo napot, Sandor!"
"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
But they did, they did like each other.
"Learn as if you'll live forever."
As it does, I suspect, that of everybody here.
This is our task; we know it will be hard.

Ellen Dunham-Jones: Retrofitting suburbia
So why is this important?
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
But is it practical?
They're the other big generation.
It no longer just makes sense.
It turns out, all sorts of things.
It's keeping the lights on.
But some of them have been much more incremental.
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's what it looks like.
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.
Here was the mall in its heyday.
So here's the site in 1975 with the mall.
By 1995, the mall has died.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But the one story stuff ...
that's really history.
So here it is at projected build-out.
It's about two-thirds built out right now.
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.
This is another re-greening example.
It also makes sense in very strong markets.
I think we have three challenges for the future.
Where should we be redeveloping?
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
They are new but trying to look old.
But we've got to get the architecture better.
The final challenge is for all of you.
So there was no job, no food.
So our patients are women and children.
And they are in our backyard.
It's our home. We welcome them.
There is no government to protect them.
That's their house.
Would you explain the rules for admission?
We are sharing with them whatever we have.
But there are only two rules.
[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.
The second: no man can beat his wife.
That's our two rules.
We can do everything.
So we came up with these two rules.
PM: You're running a medical clinic.
You're also running a civil society.
I admired them, and I decided to become a doctor.
That's why I became a doctor.
So Dr. Deqo has to explain.
I loved it, but it didn't work.
So that's how I decided [to do] the same.
My sister was different.
She's here. She's also a doctor.
She graduated in Russia also.
Most people fled abroad.
I succeeded in my place.
And I'm thankful for my daughters.
They do everything for them.
They have done what I desire to do for them.
DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.
She always expects us to do more.
That's the best part.
PM: But you do it for good reasons.
HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.
Robert Ballard on exploring the oceans
The first question is this.
Our country has two exploration programs.
And hell is down here? Is it a cultural issue?
Why are people afraid of the ocean?
I'm going to make it right now in case I forget.
Mostly discoveries made by accident.
I have a characterization.
It gives you the false impression it's a map.
No, no, that's the only place a ship's been.
Most of the southern hemisphere is unexplored.
You know, it's just ludicrous.
I believe in just enriching the economy.
This is on a Mercator projection.
We went down into the Rift Valley.
Most of our planet is in eternal darkness.
Tens of thousands of active volcanoes.
And it's then being ripped open.
It's not a flood, it was pushed up there.
It was hot. It wasn't hot enough.
So, there must be underwater hot springs.
We went up to them with our submersible.
No mouth, no gut, no digestive system.
We did not know about this life system.
We were not predicting it.
We stumbled on it, looking for some missing heat.
So, we wanted to accelerate this process.
How do you do that? That's water upside down.
Again, you know, we stop at the water's edge.
And yet we're only now penetrating it.
Finding the state of preservation.
People always ask, "Did you find the right ship?"
It said Yorktown on the stern.
More recently, finding ancient history.
This ship sank 1,500 years ago.
We begin to go on the Hill and lobby.
The Okeanos Explorer on its mission.
Its mission is as good as you could get.
We have no idea what we're going to discover.
We'll go into areas we have no knowledge of.
We can then build a command center.
We can disseminate.
I would not let an adult drive my robot.
You don't have enough gaming experience.
We need to be not only proud of our universities.
We need to be proud of our middle schools.
And when you get a jaw drop, you can inform.
And the technology is at hand.
Internet,computers,education,global issues
Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
Of course, he'd get really bored.
Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
We get unbelievable segregation.
So what made these courses so different?
You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
For example, even our videos are not just videos.
There's an optional explanation if they want.
That didn't go over really well.
So we had to come up with a different solution.
Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
Emily Levine's theory of everything
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.
I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.
I see it everywhere.
Buying it from us screams good taste."
"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts."
"Don't use big words."
"Learn the lingua franca."
Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie."
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.
And they got very upset.
But I don't engage in serious arguments.
The head is good, body bad.
Head is ego, body id.
That's how you get rationality.
Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?
So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead."
I don't know how many of you have read it.
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.
The agony as an act of passion."
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.
It's the subject subjugating the object.
That's how you assert yourself.
You make yourself the active voice.
And the object is the passive no-voice.
I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.
They don't even wait for the rest of it.
I do. I think it can go too far.
What's funny about being down to four houses?
"For sale: White trash compactor."
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."
There always had to be the butt of a joke.
And I got good at that when I was in stand up.
I used to actually hang up on them.
And that's really what I'm looking for.
And it was like being psychoanalyzed.
I mean he had laid it all out.
Trickster is a change agent.
And one of these is boundary crossing.
But I like to cross boundaries.
He was a very selfish meme.
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.
"No, you take the prize.
You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?
Where am I going? I'm going to die soon."
That's an actual quality of the trickster.
And another is, non-oppositional strategies.
And this is instead of contradiction.
I'm not sure what it's called.
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."
Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you."
I had no joke for that.
I love connections.
And the other one though is impenetrability.
And didn't that feel good?
And now we're being penetrated.
You know we're being penetrated.
That's the second of the quadruple.
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.
I still have a way to go.
And the mother is elderly.
And the mother goes right through a red light.
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
And the mother goes through a second red light.
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"
That completes the quadruple.
I just want to say two more things.
He has to have poise.
It's an actual thing.
He's always on the road.
And thank you for inviting me into it.

Stephen Petranek counts down to Armageddon
And that's what I want to talk about today.
Ah, you laugh, you fools.
Yeah, we need the time!
Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
Can we run that, Andrew?
SP: I agree with the president.
But terrorists aren't the only threat we face.
We live in an incredible age of modern medicine.
So, what are the solutions?
So, what are the solutions to this?
Thank God you can all read!
Number eight: the ecosystem collapses.
And they get to prioritize, you know?
They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
Let it recover, before we start logging again.
Number seven: particle accelerator mishap.
You all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?
They expect them to evaporate.
I hope they're right.
We shut one down that was going to be big.
We've got the fox watching the henhouse here.
Number six: biotech disaster.
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
So, what do we do about that?
It's been 780,000 years since this happened.
Oh, and here's one other thing.
So, maybe we're in the throes of it.
So, there's a fairly simple solution to this.
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.
It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.
You don't need that much up there.
Number four: giant solar flares.
Obviously, we don't want one of those.
So, what can we do about this?
Really more like 500 years to do it right.
There's no reason why we shouldn't start now.
Number three -- isn't this stuff cool?
And we know staph can do amazing things.
So, what can we do about it?
Most of them should be in orbit around something.
And also, space is incredibly vast.
And this is my scariest.
I don't have a good answer for this one.
It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
Nothing to worry about, right?
Andrew, can you put that chart up?
Now look at the one right below that.
Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
Could we have the solutions?
And they're trying to do that.
Comets are a tougher act.
We really need a dedicated observatory.
I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
Yikes! So many big threats!
The thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.
We don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
We know about this stuff.
Knowledge is power.

Basho was a brilliant man.
There are a few key points.
They define what the system is.
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.
The second one is internal energy.
That's the planet that we live on.
It's immensely complex.
And these have all co-evolved.
They interact with one another constantly.
All of them interact with one another.
We must understand it.
Look at this complexity here.
This is only one variable.
And there's an urgency to this.
This is very, very exciting.
We know little or nothing about it.
And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.
Some of you remember this, I'm sure.
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably.
The computational power is amazing.
And that's what we really need.
It was once called Neptune.
And let me show you what's behind it.
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.
You can see the copper tips on these things.
This is phenomenal bandwidth.
And this is what the planet looks like.
And the cables go really continent to continent.
They will bring it and link it in.
And this is just the first of these.
Now I want to take you into the caldera.
We're flying across the caldera floor.
There is a number of robotic systems.
It's a full spectrum of tools.
This is what it actually looks like.
Very, very powerful.
So what can we actually do tomorrow?
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.
Just as you move, it generates power.
And this is the magic one.
And that's transmitted back to land immediately.
It's far beyond what we currently have.
And they fly into the erupting volcano.
This is doable. All the pieces are there.
It's going to be amazing.
It won't be long. It won't be long.
In 1943, T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets."
He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1948.
John Kasaona: How poachers became caretakers
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.
It's called Kunene region.
This is where I'm coming from.
I'm a Himba and Namibian.
We live a very traditional lifestyle.
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."
"And he will let go of the goat and run off."
Don't move. Stand your ground.
I was born in 1971.
We lived under apartheid regime.
It killed almost everything that was left.
It's a very sad story.
The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."
"Eh? The poachers?"
"Yes. Our poachers."
And that was my father.
And here are the new ideas.
And these things we were taught by outsiders.
We learned these things from outsiders.
They were not people from outside.
These were our own people.
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
But today, there are more than 130 lions.
Don't walk out at night!
This is outside the protected area.
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.
James Balog: Time-lapse proof of extreme ice loss
These first images are from Greenland.
But ice has another meaning.
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
The changes are happening. They're very visible.
They're photographable. They're measurable.
That's outside Antarctica.
Science is not arguing about that.
And that led me to this project.
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.
That's only half our job.
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
And several things are important.
That's the natural cycle.
But 280 is the peak.
Earth is having a fever.
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.
We have to turn that around.
But anyway, off to the world of ice.
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.
This is a view of what's called the calving face.
This is an aerial picture we did this year.
That's the retreat of this glacier.
And so, there are features on this landscape.
So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.
Now we turn on our time lapse.
This camera was shooting every hour.
Geologic process in action here.
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.
That's what you see with these cameras.
The images make the invisible visible.
These huge crevasses open up.
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.
You can see this river being formed.
You can see it deflating.
So we wind time backwards now.
We go back a couple years in time.
That's where it started.
That's where it ended a few months ago.
And on up to Greenland.
It's a big place. That's all ice.
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.
The interior of Greenland is to the right.
I'll show you one of those in a second.
We had nine cameras going.
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.
Huge icebergs rolling over.
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
We have a problem of perception.
I'm certain that we can.
You're an elite audience. You get it.
environment,fish,food,oceans,sustainability
The who and the why are what's important to me.
I want to know how I impact them.
I want to know how they impact me.
I want to know why they fish.
So what do we call this?
I think we call it restorative seafood.
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
But what if we eat only in the green list?
Pole caught -- no bycatch.
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.
What's the context of this meal?
Do I do this three times a week?
That's great! I love red wine!
Well folks, we have a protein problem.
Vegetables: they might yet save the oceans.
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
This is an easy sell.
There's a pattern here.
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
So let's start there.
We have eco-friendly shrimp.
We can make them; we have that technology.
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
But it's not all about the seafood.
It's about the way that we look at our plates.
A couple things happened.
They got healthier. I made more money.
This is what we need to favor.
This is what the green list says.
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.
Put it on four plates.
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
I expect a lot from food.
I expect health and joy and family and community.
I remember well the meals of my childhood.
This is still how I largely eat today.
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.
I get the meat sweats.
It's like a hangover from protein.
Eat your vegetables.
It's pretty straightforward.
So what are we looking for in a meal?
We need to savor vegetables.
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
And we need to save dinner.

This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.
It is four in the morning."
They worked until four o'clock in the morning.
And it made me suspicious.
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
Coincidence? No, it's creepy.
Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.
Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.
Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?
It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
There's a rumble in my stomach.
Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.
I said, I know a coded message when I see one.
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
Well, how could it have?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
We might not ever know.
It could get awkward, right?
cancer,medical research,technology
Bill Doyle: Treating cancer with electric fields
And electric fields are not magnetism.
What electric fields are are a field of forces.
We can all picture astronauts in space.
They begin to be attracted towards Earth.
That's why you're all in your chairs.
And we can observe this.
And we can see them dividing throughout.
The one within the circle manages.
The one up there can't divide at all.
It's a death sentence.
We divided the patients into two groups.
He received the standard treatments.
He received surgery.
He received high dose radiation to the head.
And he received first-line chemotherapy.
He entered our trial.
And here we can see him getting the therapy.
First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.
There's none of the tiredness.
There's none of what is called the "chemo head."
There's no sensation.
This is a therapy that takes time to work.
It's a medical device; it works when it's on.
And every single morning I appreciate life.
Her cancer continued to grow.
She is managing her farm.
It's only the beginning.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.
Clouds seldom visit this area.
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.
This is a new work, it's a new program.
And they harvest rain in many ways.
And this is all big raised platform.
And the water will go where it should go.
And then it is 40 feet deep.
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.
And this is pure drinking water.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
But now you can have this for year round.
We often use a term called bylaws.
Because we are used to get written things.
But here it is unwritten by law.
These raised up platforms just like this stage.
The age is 400 years.
You can calculate the price of that water.
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.
It can break sometimes.
But they can be opened for TED people.
And we request them.
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.
And they are plaiting hair.
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
This town was established 800 years ago.
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.
This was for mass communication.
Another small water body, called the [unclear].
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But this is not ground water.
You can draw ground water from any well.
But this is no ordinary well.
It squeeze the moisture hidden in the sand.
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.
This is the same dry water body.
How they maintain them?
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.
This was done in 11th century.
And you have to go further down.
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.
Excuse me, who built these structures?
They are in front of you.
but not to create the engineering colleges.
This tire comes from the airplane.
They were using it on their body.
The center of life is water.
These are the beautiful waves.
These are the trees.
So, this is the message of desert.
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.
Or is this just right for this place?
One recharge, and one stores.
So, it depends on the terrain.
If it is there it can be done right now.
Otherwise, it can't be done.
CA: Thank you so much.
Internet,government,politics,technology,web
Evgeny Morozov: How the Net aids dictatorships
And again, I think this is kind of false.
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?
And they are building what I call the Spinternet.
Why are they engaging with cyberspace?
And, again, this is happening quite often.
But then authorities did something very smart.
People would keep talking about it for weeks.
And you may wonder why.
And first it's quite simple.
You put it on the front page of your blog.
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."
Now it's all available online.
So this is something you have to recognize.
So what should we do about it?

Tony Porter: A call to men
This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
Hold your head up. Look at me.
Explain to me what's wrong.
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
Why are you crying?"
Just go on, go on in your room.
And he's five years old.
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
I think back to my father.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
And the limousine empties out.
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was a troubled kid.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
He was being raised by his grandmother.
His father wasn't on the set.
His grandmother had two jobs.
He was home alone a lot.
He was cool. He was fine.
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
We all looked up to him.
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
Johnny call, you go.
So I run right upstairs.
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
We don't talk about that as men.
There ain't no first time.
Women are objects, especially sexual objects.
Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.
He told me to go in his room.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
Folks, I'm petrified.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
I need you on board. I need you with me.
He said to me, "I would be free."
http://www.ted.com/talks/shashi_tharoor.html
After all, what constitutes a world leader?
We will overtake China by 2034.
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
But, the fact still is that it's not just that.
I think you've already heard the figures.
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
But sometimes it just sat there.
I went to high school in Calcutta.
She can't understand the dialogue.
And this is happening more and more.
India doesn't have a military mission there.
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.
So the empire can strike back.
But, there is something more substantive to that.
It's a civilizational story to begin with.
That's the Indian story.
All the others have been all those three.
It was essentially India being itself.
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.
We've got all of that.
We can't really be both of those.
Kary Mullis' next-gen cure for killer infections
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
Actually our body doesn't hate these.
Our body loves these. It eats them.
And I said, why don't you use that?
Our antibiotics are running out.
And I feel now like George Bush.
It's like "mission accomplished."
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
Why did they not die?
So we did it. Okay?
Mission accomplished!

This is Sea-Monkeys.
Those of you with children, you know about them.
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.
She got cranky and just went home.
So, these are miracles, right?
These are truly miraculous things that happen.
And it's true. It's true.
That's over 50 percent.
And here's the thing that should freak you out.
One of the creatures we see it in is a fish.
But, of course, she was also extremely cold.
It's a really good thing.
And so, we went looking for such things.
Well, we had a lot of them.
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.
We make it ourselves.
The highest concentration is in our brains.
It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.
So, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."
It's really going to be OK."
Its oxygen consumption rate fell by tenfold.
And here's the really important point.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
Now, this was cosmic.
Well this was really cool.
So, I want to say that we're in human trials.
Dan Dennett: Cute, sexy, sweet, funny
Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.
We adore babies because they’re so cute.
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
That’s all there is to it.
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.
So nature works on many levels here.
This is the strange inversion.
And I won’t be able to say too much about it.

Tim Brown on creativity and play
This is a guy named Bob McKim.
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.
And there should be a pencil.
So, everybody ready? OK. Off you go.
You’ve got 30 seconds, you’d better be fast.
Come on: those masterpieces ...
OK? Stop. All right, now.
Yes, lot’s of laughter. Yeah, exactly.
Lots of laughter, quite a bit of embarrassment.
Yup, yup, I think I probably am.
Maybe have the same kind of security to play.
Now, that wasn’t just self-indulgence.
He knew that friendship is a short cut to play.
So all of these places have these symbols.
It’s a toy; it’s called a "finger blaster."
And I forgot to bring one up with me.
But before we start, I need just to put these on.
Thank you. All right.
I have another idea. I wanted to -- there we go.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Not bad, not bad. No serious injuries so far.
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.
So, ah, that was fun.
But why is it important?
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?
We need to figure that out pretty fast.
Well, at least, we did once.
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose.
Well, not necessarily.
Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.
So, everybody ready? OK? Off you go.
Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.
So, who got more than five circles figured out?
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?
Keep your hands up if you did 10.
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.
We stop ourselves from doing things.
We self-edit as we’re having ideas.
So it was a pretty successful evening.
We don’t know, but it may be.
And somehow that seems wrong.
I mean, can you have rules about creativity?
It’s classically learning by doing.
And in the end it turned into a real device.
And we think that’s pretty important.
Something like a service or an experience?
We’re doing the same thing as designers.
We’re trying on these experiences.
In short, we admire their willingness to play.
Play has rules, especially when it’s group play.
The kind of little face, the portrait you did?
Kids don’t play all the time, obviously.
It’s not an either/or; it’s an "and."
You can be serious and play.
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.
I can just sit back and relax."
I don't need to improve any more."
And the only thing that came was creative block.
I couldn't come up with any ideas.
And I got distracted by it.
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.
I bought a fast car.
I was faster but just as depressed.
But money can't buy happiness."
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."
And he put me on anti-depressants.
And clients didn't call.
And that was great.
So I went back to doing the projects I loved.
But it wasn't a quick trip.
It took seven years.
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.
It's a continuous journey.
So here is to your continued success.
arts,entertainment,music
I wanted to be a rock star.
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.
This was in the late '80s.
They wouldn't have me.
And I was certain that's what my life would be.
And I left the room and said, "No way."
Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.
Here's me singing "Sleep."
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.
Such an intimate video.
So I wrote on my blog, "OMG OMG."
And I sent out this call to singers.
And then as the videos started to come in ...
This is Cheryl Ang from Singapore.
This is Evangelina Etienne from Massachusetts.
Stephen Hanson from Sweden.
This is Jamal Walker from Dallas, Texas.
And a number of sopranos uploaded their parts.
Here's our winner of the soprano solo.
This is Melody Myers from Tennessee.
And Scott aggregated all of the videos.
He scrubbed the audio.
He made sure that everything lined up.
This is "Lux Aurumque" sung by the Virtual Choir.
I'll stop it there in the interest of time.
So there's more. There's more.
And I had the same reaction you did.
And the video went viral.
This time we got some more mature members.
And some younger members.
Isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever seen?
This is Beau Awtin.
And there were 900 people involved in that.
So I told the singers, "That's our goal.
That's the number for us to beat."
And I've just chosen a few of them here.
It's so wonderful to sing together again!"
Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you have heard that too.
So two things struck me deeply about this.
It doesn't matter the technology.
It wasn't a virtual choir.
This will be a premiere today.
We're not finished with the video yet.
But we do have the first three minutes.
You're the very first people to see this.
This is "Sleep," the Virtual Choir.
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Peter Norvig: The 100,000-student classroom
Everyone is both a learner and a teacher.
And that's exactly what we were aiming for.
We preferred open-ended questions.
And I like that kind of response.
That's just what we were going for.
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.
You can watch them any time you want.
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.
More important is motivation and determination.
They got this statement of accomplishment.
So what have we learned?
Sebastian's teaching another class now.
I'll do one in the fall.
It's a really exciting time.
Sheila Patek clocks the fastest animals
And that's not a joke, we really do.
So, I'll play it one more time.
And I immediately came upon a problem.
We simply couldn't capture it on video.
And so we struck up a deal.
And believe it or not, they went for it.
And we were in for our first surprise.
So that was really cool and very unexpected.
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
It's a very beautiful structure.
And I'll just do that one more time.
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.
And again, we were in for a surprise.
And again, I think this will be a world record.
But that was not the end of the story.
And that was what really got me puzzled.
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.
And what that is, is cavitation.
So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.
Graham Hawkes flies through the ocean
We still have one foot in the dark ages.
And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."
This is an ocean planet.
So I have one message.
And it’s all a question of perspective.
Well, it’s the relative importance.
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.
Because it’s a problem we have.
Okay. Let me criticize this thing.
If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.
This is an acryclic sphere.
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
Now, go into the real atmosphere of this planet.
Fish do not sit in seats.
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.
It’s truly a three-dimensional space.
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.
This is a three-dimensional machine.
OK, this is good stuff.
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.
She has twice the wingspan that I do.
There I’m coming; she sees me.
I’m trying to do everything very gently.
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.
This was a fly by wire. It has wings.
She just rolled right away from underneath.
It took 10 years to build.
I just had to go and build another machine.
This is an internal Sony camera. Thank you, Sony.
Now, there she goes, right overhead.
This is a wide-angle camera.
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head.
I come back up, not for air.
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.
It was the fact she was going so slow.
She wanted to dance.
You see the larger wing area here.
So we opened the world’s first flight school.
"I write these stinking license," which I do.
They’re one of the first subsea aviators.
So we’ve run two flight schools.
What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.

Reviving New York's rivers -- with oysters!
But one thing is clear.
So the era of big infrastructure is over.
We need new tools and new approaches.
So we need new stories, new heroes and new tools.
So we really had a lot to deal with.
And the idea has two core stages.
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.
They were key in our culture and our economy.
So again, we got the short end of the deal there.
They really become nature's wave attenuators.
Many, many species depend on them.
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?
So get your Tevas on.
So you can imagine scuba diving here.
So the water is churned through this raft.
And then those spat are then seeded.
I get asked two questions about this project.
One is: why isn't it happening now?
And the answer is: not yet, they're working.
Steven Johnson tours the Ghost Map
We had to get rid of the smell.
So it was this incredibly terrifying event.
Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
And the map is actually a little bit bigger.
Phil Borges on endangered cultures
And this happens every two weeks.
She is a 69-year-old nun.
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.
And he spent 33 years in prison.
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.
I interview and do portraits.
And this is a little girl.
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.
This is at 17,000 feet.
And he's never been back to his country since.
And he still is holding this line.
This is another leader of his people.
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
And Moi is 35 years old.
I wish they would just go away.
And then we went up and met their shaman.
And we watched and stayed with John Doolikahn.
And all the security issues they cause us.
We now have 15 sites.
That was one of the big motivating factors.
It was a two million dollar study.
We just had a workshop in Guatemala.
George Smoot on the design of the universe
It's a question of what's the continuity?
This is only 1,000 galaxies.
It's a very large number of galaxies.
We're going to try and follow it up.
Two seconds is like the present.
You'd like to have a little advance warning.
I mean, it just gives you the scale.
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.
You see the whole big picture?
And it's maturing up to the present time.
And there's some spectacular things.
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?
What kind of evidence do we have for that?
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
And just put radially they're going out that way.
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.
We only have a million galaxies, right?
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.
It's not just throwing them out at random.
There's a more complicated process going on here.
How are you going to end up doing that?
And so now we're in for some serious play.
What's the kind of technique?
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?
It's called dark matter.
So I'll show you the next movie.
So this -- we're going to zoom in.
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.
So we live in the boonies.
So we're zooming in.
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
So they're simple building blocks.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
So here's that same end result.
And it's grown up in some kind of way.
That's the issue, right?
And so here we are.
And if you could see invisible matter, too.
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.
At the beginning it's very uniform.
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
You can see that just from the map alone.
We live in an incredibly busy world.
Just 10 minutes, undisturbed?
And when I say nothing, I do mean nothing.
Simply doing nothing.
I see a lot of very blank faces.
And this is an extraordinary thing, right?
We're talking about our mind.
The result, of course, is that we get stressed.
That's really not how it has to be.
You get stressed, you do some meditation.
It was a really very stressful time.
Well, obviously it changed things.
But it was more than that.
I think the present moment is so underrated.
Forty-seven percent.
But we need to know how to do it.
That's essentially what meditation is.
Let's say this is an anxious thought.
You go back to it, repeat it. "Oh, I am worried.
You know it's wobbly, and you know that it hurts.
But what do you do every 20, 30 seconds?

Sherry Turkle: Connected, but alone?
Her text said, "Mom, you will rock."
Getting that text was like getting a hug.
And so there you have it.
I embody the central paradox.
We were exploring different aspects of ourselves.
And then we unplugged.
Now fast-forward to 2012.
I'm back here on the TED stage again.
My daughter's 20. She's a college student.
She sleeps with her cellphone, so do I.
And we even text at funerals.
People want to customize their lives.
And some people think that's a good thing.
I'm the one who doesn't want to be interrupted.
So that's the bottom line.
And we clean them up with technology.
We short-change ourselves.
My answer was no, they don't add up.
It seemed to be looking in her eyes.
It seemed to be following the conversation.
And many people found this amazing.
That robot put on a great show.
And we're vulnerable.
It doesn't face death.
It doesn't know life."
And I ask myself, "Why have things come to this?"
And we are vulnerable.
We're lonely, but we're afraid of intimacy.
But we're not so comfortable.
We are not so much in control.
And so people try to solve it by connecting.
It's shaping a new way of being.
We almost don't feel ourselves.
So what do we do? We connect more and more.
How do you get from connection to isolation?
We're smitten with technology.
But it's time to talk.
But it's not, it's early days.
I see some first steps.
Start thinking of solitude as a good thing.
Do the same thing at work.
We have everything we need to start.
We have each other.
It's like calling in the cavalry.
But our fantasies of substitution have cost us.
Anthony Atala: Printing a human kidney
The fact is that we're living longer.
So this is now a public health crisis.
It really involves many different areas.
Or we can use both.
And that's where the field is today.
But it's actually not a new field.
It's titled "The Culture of Organs."
The second challenge was cells.
Plus we have stem cells.
So we can actually use biomaterials now.
This is actually a biomaterial.
This is actually like a cotton candy machine.
You saw the spray going in.
And that's exactly what we did here.
We can also use cells alone.
These are actually cells that we obtained.
So they know what to do.
So that's actually now in patients.
We then put it in this oven-like device.
That's what you see here on the right side.
This is how it actually works.
This actually shows the actual printer.
And this actually shows that printing.
In fact, we actually have the printer right here.
Put a pair of gloves here.
Has a little bit of consistency to it.
Thank you, Dr. Kang. I appreciate it.
So this is actually a new generation.
I was able to do more things.
I was able to wrestle in high school.
I was able to be a normal kid with my friends.
I've got it for life, so I'm all set.
Luke, come up please.
JE: And Tony's done hundreds of these?
I pulled them aside.
JE: Thank you, Tony.
Now my husband, Chris, and I love this show.
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.
So what's happening here?
It's second nature to them.
So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?
The first is redistribution markets.
The second is collaborative lifestyles.
It's a scheme in the U.K.
Together they grow their own food.
Now, the third system is product-service systems.
It's kind of ridiculous, right?
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.
Yet, that car sits idle for 23 hours a day.
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
This represents an eight-year time span.
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.
Let's go back to my first example, Swaptree.
In other words, I can trust him or her.
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.
Robert Neuwirth on our "shadow cities"
Now, why do I say that?
And here are the statistics.
It was a 10 by 10 cell.
And it was set in a wider watery ooze.
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
'This place is very addictive,' he had said.
Nobody is controlling what you do.
The buildings here are multi-story.
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
They're quite vital places, these communities.
They have more things going on in them.
It's on very steep ground.
So, that's just a rock in the hillside.
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.
So, that's a restaurant.
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.
And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.
I say there are two things.
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.
So, these are the civic leaders of the future.
The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.
They're very outspoken. They're very active.
They can be community leaders.
The issue is not urban poverty.
The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.
Joseph Lekuton tells a parable for Kenya
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.
Stayed when everybody else was dropping out.
My family moved; we're nomads.
Fifty miles, 40 miles, it doesn't matter.
You slept in the bush, but you kept going.
And they were left behind, waiting to die.
But these two people worked something out.
The man on top can see, the blind man can walk.
So, this was told to me in a setup of elders.
And that man told me, "So, here you are.
We'll walk you, you lead us."
So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.
And I came for them, and that's my goal.
I'm trying to improve infrastructure.
This is the world we live in.
And this is the world your children will live in.
It’s already flattening out.
This is why it’s happening.
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
But hey, you’re listening to me.
So you’ve got that covered.
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.
Tom Honey on God and the tsunami
I am a vicar in the Church of England.
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.
But I have a problem with that.
I have chosen not to rock the boat.
And this is what I said.
A verbal response would not be appropriate.
And we want an explanation from God.
We demand an explanation from God.
Who is God in all this?"
And I am among them.
I very much relate to this idea of God.
So the first big question is about control.
So the next question is about partiality.
We cannot afford to pay so much for admission.
It is not God that I do not accept.
Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator?
We must think again about God.
Maybe God doesn't do things at all.
The people knew their God by His mighty acts.
What if God is in things?
The loving soul of the universe.
In the process of evolution.
In you, in me, mind and body and spirit.
In change and development and growth.
It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.
To what extent can we ascribe personality to God?
In the end, we have to say, "I don't know."
If we knew, God would not be God.
How could one practice such a faith?
In awareness of the inner conversation.
And how would one deepen such a faith?
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things.
Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty.
Dave Eggers' wish: Once Upon a School
I cannot believe I'm here.
I have not slept in weeks.
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.
And so we started talking about this.
I'm trying. That clock has got me.
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.
So we rented this space.
You've gotta sell something.
You can't just have a tutoring center."
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.
We never put it together, you know?
She took over as executive director.
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.
So there's no stigma.
These adults, they're working in their field.
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.
And that makes a happy family.
So the key to it all is homework!
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.
So we started bringing in classes during the day.
So this is one of the books that they do.
So then we still had more tutors to use.
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.
She's going to publish them in a book.
We had a big party at the end.
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.
It's absolutely transformative.
We sell all the student books.
Where else would you put them, right?
So it was paying the rent.
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.
And it became a gateway to the community.
People would come in and say, "What the --?
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web.
Is that a rule? I don't know.
They would say, "What is this?"
And people would come in and learn more about it.
So the store actually did really well.
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.
These are all handmade.
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
Personally, I think it's a problem.
This is a secret identity kit.
So you can see the full effect!
So this is the space during tutoring hours.
So it's school, but it's not school.
This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.
You can read this quote.
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.
And he couldn't escape it.
He's now been published in five books.
So, I'll go through really quickly.
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?
Profound leaps forward!
We created a website.
Always let the teachers lead the way.
There are a million ways.
You can do and use the skills that you have.
The schools need you. The teachers need you.

Kevin Kelly tells technology's epic story
What is the significance?
And that's the very first use of the word.
Which is, again, a sense that it's all new.
But we know that it's just not new.
Well, that's because they're all young.
So, it was a world without grandparents.
How much learning can you do?
So, that's one aspect.
Because they had banker hours basically.
So, it was possible to get enough food.
And that's why they didn't live very long.
Our bodies have adapted to these new diets.
Our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.
So, climate change is not a new thing.
So, humanity is our greatest invention.
But of course we're not done yet.
It's a very, very strong force.
It's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops.
It's the increased order.
We actually don't know.
That's where technology is going.
It's a branching off from the human form.
I use the word "want." Technology wants.
Your cat wants more food.
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.
That's what progress is about.
I think that really leads nowhere.
We fix it, but most importantly, we relocate it.
That's actually my son, right here.
We just have to find them the right place.
And we are aware of the price.
Even technology wants clean water.
Is technology diametrically opposed to nature?

It was deep at night.
I do not remember what time it was.
And I kept on staring at it until it disappeared.
I am that refugee, and I am that girl.
We only talk about one side of it.
That's what my mother in Iraq used to tell me.
It's like dying from inside-out.
We have been only seeing one side of war.
This is the language of sterility.
These just become numbers that we refer to.
It is a chess game.
We are missing a completely other side of wars.
That was her fight.
That was her resistance.
And the ones who are keeping that life are women.
There are two sides of war.
We must have a full picture of what that means.
Not one, but 50 percent.
She got a support network.
She learned about her rights.
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.
I will meet you there.
Let us make this field a much bigger place.
Let us all meet in that field.
It's poking and prying with a purpose."
We're lagging behind.
Who wants to be illogical?
We thought everyone could participate.
But the '60s left me with a problem.
I took art and ceramics. I loved dance.
Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.
Now, my mother helped me figure that one out.
It is the source of all true art and science."
You have to pull things apart.
Orchestral arranging is constructive.
Different quantum states of an atom?
They spring from the same source.
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.
They use analysis as well.
And folks say we need to choose either or.
John Maeda on the simple life
On simplicity. What a great way to start.
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
And she has this show, "The Simple Life."
So, I looked for a different show to watch.
They'll play it over, and over, and over.
So it was traumatizing, actually.
I mean that simplicity sky.
We're human beings: we love complex things.
I'm at this place called the Media Lab.
Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.
See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.
Another "Associate Director of Research."
That's my baby Reina. Thank you.
It's very hard work to make tofu.
And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.
Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
He basically said, "I've designed everything."
In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.
I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.
Lots of complex stuff.
And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.
So, I hid in a time dimension.
I built things in a time-graphics dimension.
I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
This is why they have fireworks in the summer.
A very extreme culture.
So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.
And so I made a lot of these types of things.
I feel kind of bad about that.
If you're in New York, please go and see that.
You're the guy that makes eye candy."
So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.
So, this is sort of a complication I've found.
You can't type very much on this.
So I have a crash test.
So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.
People ask me how they make the antenna.
My hair's clean -- it's okay.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?
And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity."
In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.
Because I want to simplify them for you.
When you want less, it's because it's about work.
I think this is sort of simple more versus less.
Basically, it always depends.
Like everything you see, every time you wake up.
This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
Also, if you look at your physical strength.
OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
Your social responsibility is very interesting.
And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
Al Gore's new thinking on the climate crisis
How dare we be optimistic?
Let me show you these slides here.
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
This is the winner.
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
So here's what we're doing.
But it's not just the developed nations.
This is peak fishing in a few seconds. The '60s.
We have the technologies.
People say, "What's the solution?" Here it is.
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
We need to do it for our own economy.
And it is based on an old model.
We now have a culture of distraction.
But we have a planetary emergency.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
We have the capacity to do it.
Let's do that. Thank you very much.
Al Gore: You have no idea.
"Now, even lower emissions!"
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.
We need help. We need help.
So we have to have a change in consciousness.
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
CA: Al Gore, thank you so much for coming to TED.
AG: Thank you. Thank you very much.
art,brain,design,museums
And this is what this exhibition looks at.
Other people are not as elastic.
You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.
But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.
Instead, this element here is much more banal.
So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue.
So, the more the merrier.
And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.
Mapping and tagging.
And also animal senses in a way.
Another shape is made for cancer.
They're still very useful.
And usually they are accompanied by videos.
So he designed all these series of accessories.
TED Fellows,math,physics,war
Sean Gourley on the mathematics of war
Can you get me some information?
No. So I had to think a little harder.
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.
And I saw that there was information there.
We did it in three steps.
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.
What would that tell us?
So we plot data for sample on this.
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.
This blew our mind.
Why should there be order in war?
We didn't really understand that.
So we looked at a few more conflicts.
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
So we went a little wider.
How do we explain this?
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.
We can run these simulations.
And that is what we think is happening.
Taking it forward, how do we change it?
How do we end a war like Iraq?
What does it look like?
This is what wars look like when they continue.
We've got to change that.
So this graph here, I'm going to show you now.
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.
This is when the surge happens.
The opposite happened.
The groups became stronger.
They became more robust.
And this tells me one of two things.
I don't know what the answer is to that.

One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
We all, I think, believe in compassion.
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
Because, after all, God is just.
There had to be limits to all things.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
We actually have to do something about it.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
I call that unity God.
And they say "It's 18 minutes."
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
It means it gets filled with hot air.
The cleaner came into the synagogue.
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
Ah, what a wonderful smell."
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
Takes the bread and goes home.
He goes in there, and it's not there.
Next week, with raisins."
This went on for years.
Take the bread. Take it home.
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
And he called the two of them to his office.
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.
You've misunderstood totally," he said.

Elliot Krane: The mystery of chronic pain
Please keep your seat.
A very different feeling.
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.
In fact, imagine something even worse.
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?
These glial cells become activated.
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.
The nervous system has plasticity.
It changes, and it morphs in response to stimuli.
Well, what do we do about that?
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?
But the future is actually even brighter.

Phil Plait: How to defend Earth from asteroids
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day.
The dinosaurs had a really bad day.
Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
We all live here in Boulder.
Here is how big of a crater was left.
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth.
Now, not all asteroids are that big.
Some of them are smaller.
It came in on a Friday night.
So it's about a mile across, 600 feet deep.
It was 1908. That's fine. I can live with that.
This did a huge amount of damage.
They're just not big enough.
They don't have to do global devastation.
So, now that I've scared the crap out of you ...
what can we do about this? All right?
This is a potential threat.
Well, what do we do about them?
The first thing we have to do is find them.
But you can see that it's extremely faint.
These things are faint.
They're hard to see, and the sky is really big.
We have to find these things first.
Well the good news is, we're looking for them.
NASA has devoted money to this.
I don't think Apophis is a problem.
Right? Move. The car goes past you.
And it turns out, we've even done it.
Comets are very much like asteroids.
The purpose wasn't to push it out of the way.
However, think about this.
We shot a space probe at it and hit it. Okay?
Imagine how hard that must be, and we did it.
That means we can do it again.
But just hitting something? That's pretty easy.
Well, my opinion is, fine. Okay?
It's not hitting us in six months. That's good.
Now we have three years to do something else.
And this is the part, it's the part I just love.
Instead you get near it.
So think about this, right?
This probe actually can't use chemical rockets.
Yeah, we have an ion drive now.
This happened to them.
It doesn't have to happen to us.
We have the ability to change our future.

Murray Gell-Mann on beauty and truth in physics
We'll be talking about them.
What is it made of?
And why on earth could that be so?
Well, here's an example from my own experience.
Experiments were all wrong.
The experiments had to be wrong, and they were.
I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear.
But they could be out there, very easily.
Would they really have different laws?
We may not even be terribly far from it.
I think that's the main point to be made.
We express these things mathematically.
Newton certainly believed that.
The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption.
They require very similar mathematics.
And that's why the equations look so simple.
Because they use mathematics we already have.
Here's an example of this similarity.
You look at gravity, you see a certain law.
It's a very simple example.
There are lots of more sophisticated examples.
Symmetry is very important in this discussion.
They are symmetries of the sphere.
But for the moment, that's the case.
A whole new symmetry.
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.
It's the same theory of gravity.
It stems from the character of gravity.
They are properties of the fundamental law.
They follow from the fundamental theory.
They are what we call emergent properties.
That's what emergence means.
Presumably, they mean something supernatural.
Anyway, there isn't.
culture,global issues,history,world cultures
It doesn't, I agree, look very much.
It's about the size of a rugby ball.
And you all know roughly the story.
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.
Belshazzar, his son, decides to have a feast.
It's a great story. It's story we all know.
And Cyrus makes a declaration.
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.
He'll let them return to their countries.
It's a central document in Jewish history.
This is the Jewish version of the same story.
Who is there among you of his people?
Two great texts, what about the politics?
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.
And it had to be run in a quite new way.
It had to be run in different languages.
All of those are respected by Cyrus.
The Greek invasions ended that.
And it enters now another story.
Suddenly, this appeared.
It's a great 19th century moment.
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."
It can only be Jehovah.
The question is, which god was it?
You all know what happened.
And another story of the cylinder begins.
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.
It's the only object they want.
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.
It was a huge event.
This is the other side of that same picture.
It stands with the American constitution.
A replica of this is at the United Nations.

Jeremy Gilley: One day of peace
And when I was 12, I became an actor.
I was told I was dyslexic.
In fact, I have got qualifications.
And so concern is where all of this comes from.
Maybe I could become a filmmaker.
Because it's obviously incredibly frightening.
Is that a responsible thing to do? Etc., etc.
And that was when I had the idea.
There was no starting point for peace.
There was no day of global unity.
There was no day of intercultural cooperation.
So obviously we didn't have any money.
I was living at my mom's place.
And we started writing letters to everybody.
He was a prisoner of war.
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki.
It poisoned his blood. He died when I was 11.
So he was like my hero.
And we started to build this case.
And I remember the first letter.
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama.
And we didn't have money for the flight.
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward.
And we invited everybody, and no press showed up.
For me, it was really about the process.
It wasn't about the end result.
And that's the beautiful thing about the camera.
So anyway, we began the journey.
Yeah, I'm not worried about it now.
76 countries in the last 12 years, I've visited.
I've recorded 44,000 young people.
I've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts.
And we were listening to everybody.
and working with NGOs and building this case.
I don't know how to get involved in that process.
And thank you to all of them.
That was an incredible moment.
And it was 8:00 AM when I stood there.
And we have to make this day work.
It's been created; nobody knows.
It's just symbolism.
Children can lead their projects.
That's what I'd heard.
And so I went back to the United Nations.
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan.
I won't go into that.
So I said to him, "Do you want to come with me?
It'd be really interesting if you came.
It would help and bring attention.
I think there's a number of pillars to success.
One is you've got to have a great idea.
So these guys were absolutely crucial.
There was an interest in what was going on.
And then we went home. We'd sort of done it.
We had to wait now and see what happened.
We will observe this day.
We see it as a window of opportunity.
And we gave the film over.
Obviously it was shown, and it was amazing.
They were saying they would stop.
And I was there thinking about what was going on.
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent.
We have to go for a global truce.
That's exactly what we must do.
And you can see the education box there.
Ultimately, that's what it's about."
We'll make a new film about this process.
We'll utilize sport and football.
And ultimately, we have to try that.
We have to work together.
I was with Brahimi, Ambassador Brahimi.
He's an amazing man.
And I sat with him a few weeks ago.
He said, "It's absolutely possible."
I said, "What would you do?
He said, "No, I'd talk to the individuals."
It's all about the individuals.
It's all about you and me.
It's all about partnerships.
By working together, we can create peace one day.
Thank you TED. Thank you.
Patrick Awuah on educating leaders
The emergency generators did not start.
The patient's cut open, twice.
The first time it was a C-section.
Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
And it happened twice.
Start all over again.
Now what does this have to do with leadership?
They are the elite. They are our leaders.
Their decisions, their actions matter.
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
We've heard a lot about that.
I'm talking about the elite.
And we need to train them right.
They were a pervasive presence.
No sign to this effect.
And so I started to argue with these men.
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
I learned something about courage.
It was important not to look at those guns.
It was a breath of fresh air.
They wanted us to think critically.
They wanted us to be analytical.
It matters a great deal.
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
And I was part of that.
And by the way, it's continued to.
The gap has widened since I left.
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
And they might say, "Look, don't even try."
So I decided to engage this particular problem.
And Ghana was not paying enough attention.
So this is what I'm doing now.
I think it would make a huge difference.
And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
And he signs off, "Thank you."
It's such a simple statement.
Can we create a perfect society?
I don't know ultimately what they will do.
Am I out of time? OK.
It says a lot about her.
It says a lot about her peers who elected her.
She won with 75 percent of the vote.
And it gives me a lot of hope.
We've graduated two classes of students to date.
And every single one of them has been placed.
You know, that passion for what they're doing.
It's an incredible opportunity.
It will depend on inspired leadership.
Thank you, and God bless.
Alberto Cairo: There are no scraps of men
I've been in Afghanistan for 21 years.
We do more than that.
This is the place where we make the legs.
I felt not quite ready for that job.
There was so much to learn.
There were so many things new to me.
But it was a terrific job.
There were many other things to do.
It was a strange sensation.
It's something that comes out from the past.
It's 21 years, but they are still all there.
And the orthopedic center was closed.
But one day, something happened.
I wanted to go home. I was driving.
And everybody disappeared from the street.
The cars disappeared as well.
So I stopped the car and I went to help.
The man was without legs and only with one arm.
So I took him into a safe place.
I wondered, what work?
Why don't you have the artificial legs?"
And he said, "The Red Cross has closed."
Well without thinking, I told him "Come tomorrow.
We will provide you with a pair of legs."
And then I said, "Oh, my God. What did I say?
The center is closed, no staff around.
Maybe the machinery is broken.
Who is going to make the legs for him?"
So I hoped that he would not come.
This is the streets of Kabul in those days.
So I said, "Well I will give him some money."
And I spoke with a gatekeeper.
Nothing can be done.
Give him some money."
But Mahmoud and his son were already there.
And they were not alone.
There were 15, maybe 20, people like him waiting.
And there was some staff too.
We have to go away. We cannot stay here."
So, "We cannot stay here, it's dangerous.
It's not a priority."
But Najmuddin told me, "Listen now, we're here."
I said, "No, please. We cannot do that.
It's really dangerous.
We have other things to do."
So we started doing some repairs.
Maybe some of them are here now.
He was telling me, "Patients are coming."
But people were coming.
And Mahmoud was coming every day.
He was coming every day, crossing the front line.
But finally, the great day arrived.
It was April, I remember, a very beautiful day.
So we chose a small spot in the garden.
Suddenly, they started fighting.
Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.
We could hear in the air the bullets passing.
So we dashed, all of us, towards the shelter.
Mahmoud grabbed his son, I grabbed someone else.
Everybody was grabbing something.
And Mahmoud, "Of course I can.
I can run, and now you can go to school.
Later on, we took them home.
Dignity cannot wait for better times.
From that day on, we never closed a single day.
I met Mahmoud one year later.
He was in good shape -- a bit thinner.
I asked about his son.
But I understood he wanted to tell me something.
So I asked him, "What is that?"
He was clearly embarrassed.
He said, "You have taught me to walk.
Now help me not to be a beggar anymore."
"My children are growing.
I thought, how much money do I have in my pocket?
Just to give him some money.
It was the easiest way.
He read my mind, and he said, "I ask for a job."
And then he sat down.
I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.
"What?" I said, "Stop."
We need to increase the production."
I could not believe.
I said, "Listen, it's insane.
That's a production line and a very fast one.
But with Najmuddin, we cannot discuss.
I told Najmuddin, "That's a trick.
I can't believe it."
The production was up 20 percent.
"It's a trick, it's a trick," I said.
And then I asked for verification.
I understood that I was wrong again.
Mahmoud had looked taller.
He was a new man, taller again.
So of course, I understood.
It's good for everybody.
But also for the newcomers.
Sometimes you see them, they look, "Oh."
And you see the faces.
And then the surprise turns into hope.
Scraps of men do not exist.
People like Mahmoud are agents of change.
And when you start changing, you cannot stop.
And when you start, you cannot stop.
There is always a better way to do things.
That's Najmuddin, the one with the white coat.
Terrible Najmuddin, is that one.
They are my teachers.
It is possible and it is not difficult.
This is my big wish.
We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.
I said, "No," you can imagine.
I said, "No, no, no, no, we can't."
Is it really necessary?"
Well now you should see me.
I never miss a single training session.
The night before a match I'm very nervous.
And you should see me during the match.
I shout like a true Italian.
What's next? What is going to be the next change?
That was my story. Thank you very much.

I call myself a body architect.

James Randi's fiery takedown of psychic fraud
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?
It's a beard trimmer, you see?
You believe I'm looking at you.
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.
These are not glasses, these are empty frames.
Quite empty frames.
Don't you ever forget that.
But I'm going to take some medication.
This is a full bottle of Calms Forte.
I'll explain that in just a moment.
I will take enough of these. Mm.
Indeed, the whole container.
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.
You might agree with me on that.
I wonder if that's true.
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.
And she didn't answer the damn question!
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.
Is this a hunting game?
Hunting and fishing? What is it?
Folks, that's what dying is all about!
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."
It was a game of hunting questions like this.
This is what they go through.
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.
We call her "The Talons."
That's her, you can tell right away.
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.
We all know who he is on television.
He just doesn't care.
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.
It's very easy, win the million dollars.
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.
I'm alive, you may have noticed.
Well, pretty well anyway.
Now, I popped some pills earlier.
I have to explain that to you.
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.
Hmm. You've heard of it.
It's an alternative form of healing, right?
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.
Why don't they affect me?
The answer may surprise you.
What is homeopathy?
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.
He died of an overdose.
He forgot to take his pill.
Work on it. Work on it.
They might, some place out there.
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.
If you find out -- now I understand.
And we must do something about those problems.
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.
That's what they're looking at.
We really must do something about this.
It's www.randi.org.
You will see the records that we have.
She did accept and then backed away.
Erica Frenkel: The universal anesthesia machine
I study health systems in these countries.
It's a pretty expensive machine.
Those machines go the proverbial junkyard.
And everything began pretty auspiciously.
The surgeon was on call and scrubbed in.
The nurse was there.
There has to be something better."
Everything else is the same.
But we've put a long-life battery backup on here.
This is the only part that's battery backed up.
And so we've just added this manual bellows.
So it's a straightforward machine.
I shudder to say simple; it's straightforward.
And it's by design.
This is an incredibly rugged machine.
And finally, it's affordable.
But we're not content to stop there.
Is this the design that's going to work in place?
Well we've seen good results so far.
Who gets surgery and who doesn't?
Who gets safe surgery and who doesn't?

Mark Bittman on what's wrong with what we eat
I write about food. I write about cooking.
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
And why do I say it?
There was the bomb, and there's now.
Then hear this, please.
Now global warming was unforeseen.
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.
But back to animals and junk food.
What do they have in common?
One: we don't need either of them for health.
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
Now, let's imagine a parallel.
Incredible, isn't it?
And they do this here. It's the same deal.
Now, don't get me wrong.
That's our number. 10 billion.
That's just the United States.
They both get it wrong, though.
A hundred years ago, guess what?
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.
Margarine didn't exist.
There were no restaurant chains.
And fancy food was entirely French.
You didn't claim to be anything.
Vitamins had not been invented.
The cornflake hadn't been invented.
And again, everyone ate local.
Oranges became common in New York.
Thus arrived convenience.
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.
New drugs kept them healthy.
Well, they kept them alive.
Healthy was another story.
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.
Meat consumption increased five-fold.
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.
Not that they were any good, but they were there.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.
We weren't all hippies, either.
Many people became fat-phobic.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.
Think of the frozen chicken nugget.
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?
And zapped horribly, pathetically.
Leading the way -- what's leading the way?
So, now we clamor for organic food.
Let me pose you a question.
Now here is where we all meet.
We need to start acting.
How much livestock do you need to produce this?
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?
Isn't meat eating essential to health?
Ann Cooper's right.
The USDA is not our ally here.
And that happens to be quite easy.
Less meat, less junk, more plants.
It's a simple formula: eat food.
We have to choose that path.

I also knew that I'm not alone.
So why was I stalling?

It's called weekday veg.
On the weekend, your choice.
The program has been great, weekday veg.

Tom Shannon: The painter and the pendulum
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
My sculptures are normally very simplified.
I try to refine them down to very simple forms.
JH: And they're non-deterministic.
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.
JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.
TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.
JH: Whoa. That is ...
TS: So something like this.
JH: That's fantastic.
JH: So many forces there.
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.
TS: It is the paint actually, makes it real.
It's really manifested there.
There are lots of things that appear.
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
Is that relevant to your work?
I mean, I've got the symptoms.
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.
JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.
You think of yourself as the servant.
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.
It just has so much in it.
It's a terrific studio assistant.
TS: Thank you, John.

Shea Hembrey: How I became 100 artists
And my dad is the most voracious reader I know.
He can read a novel or two a day.
So I should talk about art.
So I decided, I'm going to start my own biennial.
One of them, I call my Mimaw's Test.
I'm just going to make the whole thing myself.
And so this is what I did.
So I thought, a biennial needs artists.
It's going to be two years of studio work.
So I should start to talk about these guys.
Well the range is quite a bit.
This isn't Photoshopped.
I'm under the river with those fish.
This is Nell Remmel.
And this is 22 feet long.
And I love to dig a hole.
And she's making weather on her body's scale.
And this piece is "Frost."
The sun rises, and it melts away.
And that was played by my mom.
One of these is scratch-off masterpieces.
He draws sticks real good."
Which is one of the best compliments ever.
This project is called "Love Nests."
And this one's called "Lovelock's Nest."
This one's called "Mixtape Love Song's Nest."
And this one's called "Lovemaking Nest."
Next is Sylvia Slater.
Sylvia's interested in art training.
She's a very serious Swiss artist.
And this one had to get broken up.
So they came up with "dig jigs."
And we got a lot of attention when we did it.
That's my mom and dad.
This is by Jason Birdsong.
We just have that natural way of seeing.
And he plays with this idea.
And this piece: those aren't actually leaves.
So he pairs these up.
There's another pile of leaves.
Those are actually all real butterfly specimens.
And he pairs these up with paintings.
Like this is a painting of a snake in a box.
But it's actually a painting.
The next artist is Hazel Clausen.
So that's what she did.
And that's the symbol of their culture.
This is a typical angora embroidery for them.
This is one of their founders, Gert Schaeffer.
And actually this is my Aunt Irene.
And this is called "Horse Sense Fence."
Next is Maynard Sipes.
Next is Ginger Cheshire.
And that's my cousin and my sister's dog, Gabby.
The next, this is by Sam Sandy.
This is from Estelle Willoughsby.
She heals with color.
Next is by Vera Sokolova.
And I have to say, Vera kind of scares me.
Next, this is by Thomas Swifton.
And after this one, there's 77 other artists.

Robert Lang folds way-new origami
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
It ties to origami. So let me start.
And that is what origami used to be.
But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
It shows these women playing with these toys.
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane.
And that might have been the case.
Naturalism. Detail.
And it raises a question: what changed?
And that leads to a very powerful tool.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
They have to obey four simple laws.
And they're very simple, easy to understand.
All of origami comes from that.
If we obey these laws, we can do amazing things.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
What matters is what we mean by those symbols.
And yeah, you really can.
So let me stretch out that equation.
I start with my idea. I abstract it.
Now the first step, pretty easy.
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.
But we're going to start small.
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
How would you make a single flap?
What paper went into that flap?
I can use it for something else.
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.
There are other dimensions for flaps.
There's other ways of making flaps.
So now we're ready to scale up.
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.
And it's so simple.
It's so simple that a computer could do it.
Or you could do a moose.
Or, really, any other kind of deer.
These techniques revolutionized this art.
I call it "Snack Time."
And you can do more than just insects.
This tree frog has toes.
You can make multiple subjects.
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.
Do a little more complicated instrument."
Well, then you could do an organ.
But I want to show you some examples.
Just to show you, this really was folded paper.
And I want to show you some of these examples.
And he used it to design this solar array.
They called it the Eyeglass.
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
So you have to do something like this.
This was a small model.
Now, there is other origami in space.
And this example is the latter.
And they want to do their design by simulation.
And so they can do a simulation like this.
And that leads to a really interesting idea.
You know, where did these things come from?

Hanna Rosin: New data on the rise of women
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.
Not a lot of women did.
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.
And now look at this second set of slides.
Women, a majority of the workplace.
Now what does that mean?
This has been going on for 40 years now.
So what's that about?
But of course, it's not about that.
But that really isn't true anymore.
You would be issuing orders from above.
You would be very hierarchical.
You would tell everyone below you what to do.
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.
And those are all things that women do very well.
And here the story is fairly simple.
Why? This is a real mystery.
Noah: The girls are obviously smarter.
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.
They learn much faster.
They are more controlled.
Hanna Rosin: And why is that?
HR: So there you go.
And this was kind of a shocker to me.
And this was very disheartening for them.
"That's your salary.
So who's the man now?" he asked them.
"Who's the damn man?
She's the man now."
And that really sent a shudder through the room.
It's happening all over the world.
And now look at the chart.
That's from 1985 to 2003.
How much do you prefer a first-born son?
And they come up in lots of different forms.
So we have the perpetual adolescent.
We have the charmless misanthrope.

Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.
Now I've never really liked this term.

YB: And we made a baby.
FN: Can you bring out our baby?
This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
It's got an amazing user experience.
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi on flow
And this seemed very interesting to me.
And that hasn't changed at all.
And the interview was 40 pages long.
But this man doesn't need to go there.
That's why you can't hear more than two people.
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
So existence is temporarily suspended.
And it happens in different realms.
For instance, a poet describes it in this form.
But it happens in other activities.
It's not very challenging any more.
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.
Leah Buechley: How to “sketch” with electronics
Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.

Hans Rosling on global population growth
This box contains one billion people.
And they lived away then.
And their aspiration was to buy a car.
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.
Just look how many.
So this is where they are today.
They are now buying cars.
This is the new world we have today in 2010.
And what will happen in the future?
Well, I'm going to project into 2050.
They will start flying.
And they will start to buy electric cars.
This is what we will find there.
So what about the poorest two billion?
What about the poorest two billion here?
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.
Because we already have this [growth] in process.
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles.
The colors show the continent.
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.
They are still up here.
And the population will double in one generation.
Child survival is the new green.
And will it happen?
I'm a very serious "possibilist."
We can have a much more just world.
And look at the position of the old West.
This will not happen [again].
But it's a very important role.
Do it well and get used to it.

I'm not sure exactly how much.
This is separate from vitamin D.
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.

We fast-track. We figure out the game.
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.
So I just figured that out earlier.
In managerial accounting, I'm chapter eight.
I open up chapter eight talking about budgeting.
But kids, you can see these signs in them.
It doesn't mean you have to get through school.
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.
And I said, "Let's go and look in the basement."
And so I'll just go get them.
I sold license plate protectors door to door.
And he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me ever.
And he's like, "Well, we don't need one."
And he said, "I know."
I learned that at a young age.
I did comic book arbitrage.
You've got this demand over here that has money.
So that's obvious, right.
It's like a recession. So, there's a recession.
So I would collect the tips and get payment.
So I would go and collect for all the papers.
He could just deliver them.
Because then I realized I could make the money.
They had this old brass and copper.
I saw there was money in garbage.
And I thought that was kind of cool.
and making money off that too.
And you'd make these chairs.
And you could stuff pins in them.
It was, "Which color would you like?"
So I learned that lesson at a young age.
I learned that manual labor really sucks.
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.
Because you can't sell them more.
And people could never get their bags up it.
I went and got golf balls from golf courses.
You just pick them up with both feet.
You can't do it on stage.
So I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right?
I packaged them up three ways.
Those sold for two dollars each.
And they could use those for practice balls.
But it paid the bills.
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
That was cool because then I had retail outlets.
And I think I was 14.
Supply, demand, big opportunity.
It had our university logo on it.
Why don't you teach them not to waste money?
And I remember that lesson to this day.
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.
Come to me and tell me what it is.
And then you know what we do? We negotiate.
They go around looking for what it is.
Shit, you've missed 25 years.
Don't read them bedtime stories every night.
My kids do that all the time.
Just do that kind of stuff and have fun with it.
Show them the grumpy employees.
Say, "By the way, that guy's a crappy employee."
And say, "These ones are good ones."
My kids love this stuff.
Look for that kind of stuff.
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease.
We wouldn't have have that stuff, right?
Because there's huge opportunities in that.
I want to close with a quick little video.
These guys, Grasshopper.
It's about kids. It's about entrepreneurship.

Anthony Atala on growing new organs
That was back in 1954, 55 years ago.
Certainly many advances, many lives saved.
But we have a major shortage of organs.
That really has to do with our aging population.
We're just getting older.
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.
These are major issues.
This is actually a very stunning statistic.
We've talked about stem cells tonight.
That's a way to do it.
This is actually a picture of a salamander.
You see here a little video.
You see the scar form.
And that scar actually grows out a new limb.
So, salamanders can do it.
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?
Actually, we can regenerate.
As you age, as you get older.
Your bones regenerate every 10 years.
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.
So, your body is constantly regenerating.
The challenge occurs when there is an injury.
So, how can we harness that power?
And you see that it is injured.
That's exactly what you see here.
This was an injured urethra on the left side.
We used that biomaterial in the middle.
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.
Then we can start to use cells.
It disintegrates a few months later.
It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.
And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.
What about other structures?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel.
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.
You place the muscle cells on the outside.
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.
But they are really acting mostly as conduits.
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
So, the bladder is one such organ.
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.
We place it back into this oven-like device.
This actually shows the scaffold.
We exercise these prior to implantation.
And then the most complex are the solid organs.
It's now being seeded with cartilage.
This is actually digits that we're engineering.
We then start adding the muscle on top.
And you start layering these solid structures.
This is actually your typical desktop printer.
We can use it from one patient to the next.
You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.
We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.
And we can then create functional livers.
And that's actually what you're seeing.
They are actually making urine.
Why? Because they will not reject.
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.
And for those we still need stem cells.
So, these are very tough technologies.
But it takes a lot to get there.
So, I always like to show this cartoon.
This is how to stop a runaway stage.
He finally stops the runaway stage.
I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.
But actually method A is the correct approach.
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.
We are just taking five seconds.
The story begins in the late '90s.
Expertise has for sure had its moments.
But the price of its dominance is enormous.
What kind of a world should we be making?
What kind of a world can we be making?"
And that was only the beginning.
We are playing with fire.
So the conversation began at Bennington.
But so does the importance of content.
This discovery is transforming.
This is a political education, to be sure.
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
So we are doing our job.
We actually do it all the time.
That is where you come in.
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
Well, you have two things.
You have a mind. And you have other people.
Start with those, and change the world.

Lawrence Lessig: Re-examining the remix
Now, I know what you're thinking.
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
Finally, truth will be brought here.
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.
That's it. Please save this.
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.
And I'm not talking about the God thing.
They hold potluck dinners.
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
They serve food to poor people.
They share, they give, they give away for free.
And not only food, right.
That's the thing I want you to think about them.
Now, I know you don't believe me, really, here.
So here's exhibit number one.
Okay, so Julian made this video.
So here he is beginning.
Which, of course, spread virally.
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
They decided they wanted to do the same.
Here's lesson number one.
LL: Right. Bingo. Point.
The point is they, he, here, gets that culture.
All right, take for example this great company.
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.
This guy is no Republican.
The mashup is owned by Lucas.
There is no creator here to be recognized.
The creator doesn't have any rights.
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.
So I didn't think much about it.
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
And I felt like I was in third grade again.
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?
We need to speak of those values.
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.
It's a value of the limits in regulation.
It's a value respecting the creator.
Anyway, please join me in teaching these values.
And I believe the answer is yes.
And that is exactly what we found.
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
business,history,technology,web
So let's just run through these guys.
This is Vannevar Bush.
And the article was called "As We May Think."
The brain works by association.
Now this was in 1945.
And nobody knew anything about it.
So this was before the computer was invented.
And he proposed this machine called the memex.
And this is Doug Engelbart.
He had his head mic like I've got.
And he works this system.
So this is where the mouse came from as well.
So this is Doug Engelbart.
And this began to get a head of steam.
The magazines started to cover it.
And our PC version became quite mature.
We called it hml: hypertext markup language.
And he said, "I need to talk to you."
So we didn't do it.
And I saw it, and I thought, yep, that's it.
So that puts me in pretty illustrious company.
That's what you'd call a social news website.
But this isn't even about Reddit itself.
It's actually about humpback whales.
These humpback whales were getting killed.
I believe this is a Farsi word for "immortal."
And then there was this: Mister Splashy Pants.
Well, that got us a little angry.
So, we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.
So, there was a clear lesson here.
Which is obvious. It's a great name.
And I think that's what helped drive this.
They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins.
And this is kind of how the Internet works.
illusion,magic,technology
So these are my illusion glasses.
They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.
All we need is a playing card. Any card will do.
All right. Very significant mark.
Voice: System ready. Acquiring image.
There are 13 cards in each suit.
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that.
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.
Joker: Ready! MT: Let me see what you've got.
Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh!
I'm performing for you.
Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7.
Well, to this, I just say, no no.
Actually, in German, it's nein nein.
Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand.
The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one.
business,china,culture,economics,global issues
Martin Jacques: Understanding the rise of China
Goldman Sachs projected 2027.
The post-crisis projection is 2020.
That's just a decade away.
This is an illusion.
How do we try to understand what China is?
It's never been the case.
And what does it mean?
I'll give you two quick ones.
It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.
One country, two systems.
We were wrong. Why were we wrong?
Think of German unification, 1990.
One nation, one system.
That is the nation-state mentality.
The Chinese don't feel like that.
China is only multiracial really at the margins.
So the question is, why?
It's had no serious rivals.
The state is everywhere in China.
It's kind of arrogant.
And secondly, it's ignorant.
I mean, take the question of East Asia.
Now the largest economic region in the world.
And there are two consequences of this.
Europe was not at the final negotiating table.
When did that last happen?
Take the 19th century, for example.
But this, alas, is no longer true.
It doesn't even look like a railway station.
Okay, so how would I like to finish?
That's what Europe and North America represented.
I think they're playing golf.
Christ, the Chinese even invented golf.
Welcome to the future. Thank you.
Onyx Ashanti: This is beatjazz
Accelerometers on each hand read hand position.
a button, two guitar picks and lots of hot glue.
And "BeatJazzers" become as common as D.J.'s.
to MAKE the future rather than wait for it.
china,culture,entertainment,music,world cultures
I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
And they said, "Hey, do you want to jam?"
And I was like, "Sure."
In fact, I went to Nashville.
And after a few months I was writing songs.
[Chinese] Outside your door the world is waiting.
Inside your heart a voice is calling.
And I've played thousands of shows.
And I see the power of music.
I see the power of music to connect cultures.
And they're like, "What's that girl doing?"
It's just incredible.
And this little girl comes up to me.
And I sat down, she sat on my lap.
She started singing her song.
You have to make a wish to save the world."
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.
The world is fucked up.
Except maybe French people.
I can't do anything to save the world."
Could art change the world?
I started when I was 15 years old.
Each trip was an excursion, was an adventure.
That's on the Champs-Elysees.
I was quite proud of that one.
November 2005: the streets are burning.
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens.
It was the only one I had at that time.
So you can do it only with their trust.
So could art change the world?
Are they so different?
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other.
We called the project Face 2 Face.
The experts said, "No way.
The people will not accept.
"It will be as big as your house."
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life.
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.
We're in Ramallah right now.
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."
And then there was always a silence.
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."
And most of them couldn't say.
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.
They are not meant to stay.
I called that project Women Are Heroes.
I just took their pictures and pasted them.
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.
All Brazil was shocked.
So I decided to go there.
And she said, "You know what?
We're hungry for culture.
We need culture out there."
So I went out and I started with the kids.
I took more photos, and we started the project.
You see that enough in the media.
What I want to show is the incredible life.
Everyone there understood the project.
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.
I mean, you should see that.
So how can we know about the project?
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"
Art. Just doing art.
Don't you have color in France?"
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"
And then it becomes more.
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.
Then art becomes useful.
So the people kept it.
So I asked the people what happened.
"Oh, that guy just moved."
When you look at Kibera now, they look back.
In India it was just impossible to paste.
So we decided to paste white, white on the walls.
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"
Of course, they were confused.
So we didn't get caught this time.
For each project we do a film.
And the photo kept traveling even without us.
Behind each image is a story.
We did that in most of the places.
We go back regularly.
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.
But tell me, advertising for what?
But they asked me for a promise basically.
So I did. That's Paris.
You understand the full scope of the project.
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.
In some ways, art can change the world.
Art can change the way we see the world.
Art can create an analogy.
When I do my work, I have two kinds of reactions.
They would be really useful."
Or, "How can we help?"
And this starts right now.
Yes, everyone in the room.
I wanted that wish to actually start now.
What we see changes who we are.
And this starts right now and depends on you.
Lisa Gansky: The future of business is the "mesh"
I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.
We've shared transportation.
More people, smaller spaces, less stuff.
For example, I want to use Zipcar.
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.
They did not invent car-sharing.
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.
Zipcar got some really important things right.
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.
They made it aspirational.
They picked these sexy cars.
They targeted to universities.
What percentage of the time?
Those are really very good.
So people have created this business.
Zipcar started a decade earlier, in 2000.
So, really interesting.
So it's like vacation rentals for cars.
Because it just creates more flexibility.
It allows us as owners to have other options.
And I think we're going there anyway.
Platforms are invitations.
And honestly, it's full of surprises.
Google has made available transit data API.
That space is not vital.
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.
And this is a very mesh-y thing.
So this is an example.
It's very cost-effective, and it's very mesh-y.
The infrastructure enables that.
They made a lot of mistakes.
They had some number of big successes.
And it grows on a very regular daily basis.
But it's very much at the beginning.
And thank you very much.

Raghava KK: Five lives of an artist
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.
I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.
I'm not on top of the class.
This is a part of that.
And I became a school hero.
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.
I have to tell you a little bit about my family.
That's my mother. I love her to bits.
She's a bit of a hippie.
My father's a little different.
And I said, "Hold that thought."
I said, "Can I quit school then?"
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.
And mad and crazy and fun.
When I was 18 I started my own school.
I had to meet my Prime Minister.
I saw layers of security.
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."
He said, "Oh, so am I."
This is one I remember fondly.
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"
In the morning, I am born again."
So, I tried going to the art store.
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.
They had to be larger than life.
It was so exciting.
Except, I even started painting dancers.
But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.
And I sat like you guys there in the audience.
And I saw my work come alive.
The collaborative effort was fabulous.
I started doing fashion.
This is a fashion show we held in London.
They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."
American education is so expensive.
And I wondered how they did it from so close.
This is another painting.
Netra and I met when she was 18.
I lived in India. She lived in America.
I did that twice, and I went broke.
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"
She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.
That's us in New York.
Notice one thing, we're equal here.
Something happened along the line.
I loved the attention.
I said, "Let's get married."
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.
My mother fell very ill.
And I was devastated.
I had shows booked up for another year.
And I couldn't. I could not.
My life was not exuberant.
I could not live this larger than life person.
I lost all my audiences.
"No thank you," was more like it.
Of course, none of them liked it.
My works also turned autobiographical.
At this point, something else happened.
So, after this, my works turned a little violent.
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.
This time I said let's try something different.
I need to be reborn again.
How can a family get dysfunctional?
And Rudra was born.
That's my little son.
You know I sat at home and I watched.
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.
And this was just eight months ago.
I moved back to New York, my work has changed.
It talks about mental incest.
But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.
But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.
These are just different cartoons.
I met Belinda when she was 16.
They, in fact, told me three weeks.
And I drew it out for her.
For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.
Ian Goldin: Navigating our global future
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.
And it's clearly in the area of finance.
Globalization is getting more complex.
And this change is getting more rapid.
The future will be more unpredictable.
It did this a thousand years ago.
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.
But there is an underbelly.
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.
So what will this do?
It will create huge opportunities in technology.
Miniaturization as well.
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.
We can develop any part of the body.
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.
But the question is, "Who will have it?"
So forget about retirements if you're young.
This would imply a massive leap in migration.
And then, the systemic risks.
It's going to require innovation.
It is vital that we do so.

Geoff Mulgan: A short intro to the Studio School
What I want to talk about today is one idea.
You work by learning, and you learn by working.
We started with two schools.
That's grown this year to about 10.
We think we're onto something.
It doesn't animate them.

Tim Ferriss: Smash fear, learn anything
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.
Obviously, you see the resemblance.
And this routine went on for some time.
When I was seven I went to summer camp.
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.
You could jump off the end into the deep end.
I was born premature. I was always very small.
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.
And I've always had buoyancy problems.
But I would go in on occasion.
That is something that I did not get over.
But there is a happy ending to this story.
And I would like to share my art.
Swimming, first principles.
First principles, this is very important.
So the clock started ticking.
I tried kickboards.
Hand paddles, everything.
The problem is hydrodynamics.
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.
And so his entire body really is underwater.
The arm is extended below the head.
Here is an example of the stroke.
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.
You can see this is the left extension.
Then you see his left leg.
Not their fault, honestly.
And that will get you very far.
That's it. That's really all you need to know.
Languages. Material versus method.
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.
So, But I didn't say . I said, . Pretty close.
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.
I walked in to school.
Asked him what this said.
And so it came to me in waves.
There had been something lost in translation.
And that's pretty much my response.
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.
Nothing worked until I found this.
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.
You can also do this with grammar.
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.
And now I love languages.
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.
And so I ended up walking like this.
Not very good for ballroom dancing.
The instructor says, "You are participating."
Immediately: death sweat.
"Okay, come on, grab me."
Gorgeous assistant instructor.
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.
And she looked up and said, "Now that's better."
So I bought a month's worth of classes.
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.
Secondly, different types of pivots.
Thirdly, variation in tempo.
I want you to see part of what I practiced.
I'm going to jump forward here.
His name is Gabriel Misse.
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.
That's just one benefit of that.
So then we broke it down.
This would be an example of one pivot.
This is a back step pivot.
There are many different types.
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.
Apply them to very big dreams.
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

Einstein the Parrot talks and squawks
Can you tell everybody your name?
Einstein: Einstein.
SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?
E: [Squawks] SW: Yeah.
Einstein: [Coughs] SW: Yeah.
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.
It would be very dangerous if you fell down.
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat] SW: Yeah.
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
SW: Do your head now.
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
E: [Operatic squawk] SW: Very good.
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?
Einstein, can you also sing?
E: What's the matter?
You like to drink water.
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.
What do you say to a good-looking man?
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?
E: Happy birthday to you.
SW: What about the other birds?
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.
SW: And the penguin?
E: Quack, quack, quack.
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.
E: Oink, oink, oink.
SW: And the rooster?
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!
SW: And how about those cats?
SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.
SW: What about a skunk?
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.
Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.
Why do we want to protect your home?
SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss?
SW: Good job. Thank you all.

Jonathan Eisen: Meet your microbes
I'm going to start with a little story.
I had basically digested away my body.
And that's where I need my assistant here now.
You may recognize her.
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
The microbes that cover us.
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.
So people are really into cleanliness, right?
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
They're microbes. They're tiny.
We are them. They are us.
Jimmy Wales on the birth of Wikipedia
So we've got over 600,000 articles in English.
So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion.
It's a very unusual and chaotic thing.
We've got over 90 servers now in three locations.
You could never afford to do this in a company.
And everything is managed by the volunteers.
And that's essentially our main cost.
The media has covered this somewhat extensively.
It started out with an article in Red Herring.
So how do we do this?
How do we manage the quality control?
So real-time peer review.
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages.
Like I say, it's a tight knit community.
So how's all this governed?
There's a certain amount of aristocracy.
It just isn't appropriate.
Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up.
That's neo-Nazi math for you.
Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders.
And I said, "Well, they don't all hate it."
But I think there's going to be huge impacts.
Helen Fisher studies the brain in love
So, this is the short story of that research.
His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
He stood over six feet tall.
So, he built a temple in her honor, facing his.
Around the world, people love.
They tell myths and legends about love.
But love isn't always a happy experience.
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.
I've never had the opportunity to say it before.
I remember what you said to me.
I am thinking of your love for me.
I am torn by your love for me.
I am told you will go from here.
I am told you will leave me here.
My body is numb with grief.
Remember what I said, my love.
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."
It's way below your cognitive thinking process.
It's below your emotions.
Romantic love is an obsession. It possesses you.
You lose your sense of self.
Somebody is camping in your head.
And indeed, we now know why.
How, you know, what have I lost?
It is a need. It is an urge.
It is a homeostatic imbalance.
As a matter of fact ethologists know this.
And I just simply say, "Hardly."
And I said, I don't know.
And so, I've spent the last three years on this.
And that's about it, that's all they know.
I think there's biology to that.
These are two women.
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking.
This is intimacy to women.
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing.
So my final statement is: love is in us.
It's deeply embedded in the brain.
Raul Midon plays "Tembererana"
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.
I wish I had that when I was in college.
It's called "All the Answers."
That's the first time I've ever played it.
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.
And it's a made-up word.
It's called "Tembererana."
So this is called "Tembererana."

Yves Rossy: Fly with the Jetman
Yves uses his body to steer the wing.
He's acting as a human fuselage, so to say.
And that's quite unique.
There is Yves Rossy.
And I think the wing is open, the wing is open.
So our first critical moment, it's open.
He is down. Is he flying?
Commentator Two: It looks like he's stabilized.
He's starting to make his climb.
He's out over the channel.
There is no turning back now.
He is over the English Channel and underway.
Commentator: There he is.
Yves Rossy has landed in England.
And his equipment as well.
Yves, welcome. It is quite amazing.
And there were many, many others.
So it's possible to fly almost like a bird.
What is it [like] to be up there?
Yves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun.
I don't have feathers.
But I feel like a bird sometimes.
BG: How did you start to become Jetman?
You take a position like that.
And that's the nearest thing to the dream.
You have no machine around you.
You are just in the element.
It's very short and only in one direction.
YR: It's about 300 km per hour before looping.
That means about 190 miles per hour.
I have 55 kilos on my back.
BG: And you're not piloting?
There is no handle, no steering nothing?
And I wanted to keep this freedom of movement.
I want to go down like that.
And up I climb, I turn.
It's really pure flying.
It's not steering, it's flight.
YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.
I don't do special physical training.
So you have to adapt.
So Breitling's four engines.
YR: Yeah, two-meter span.
Ultrastable profile.
Harness, parachute.
My only instruments are [an] altimeter and time.
I know I have about eight minutes fuel.
So just check before it's finished.
And yeah, that's all.
And this is my life.
That's the real important thing about safety.
So I did try to take, again, a climb altitude.
I thought, okay, I will go out.
But most probably I did something like that.
BG: Something that is not very safe in image.
So the next thing I saw was just blue.
I have also an audible altimeter.
And then I did open my chute.
BG: I see. Maybe come back here.
This is risky stuff indeed.
People have died trying to do this kind of thing.
I assume you have standards.
YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.
BG: Let's not tell you employer.
YR: No, that's really two worlds.
We have a hundred years of experience.
And you can adapt really precisely.
With that, I have to adapt to something new.
That means improvise.
So plan B, always a plan B.
In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.
That's my ejection seat.
BG: It's well said. It's well said.
What happens if one of the engines stops?
Did you land on the rim, down at the bottom?
YR: It was down on the bottom.
But it was too stoney and full of cactus on top.
BG: That's exactly why I asked the question.
YR: And also the currents are quite funny there.
YR: I have a standard answer.
Have you ever seen tandem birds?
BG: Perfect answer.
Yves, one last question.
What's next for you? What's next for Jetman?
YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.
I want to share it, to do formation flights.
BG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?
Really, I go step by step.
It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.
And I hope it will be for everybody.
BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.
David Deutsch: A new way to explain explanation
But they failed, almost completely, to make any.
They didn't know how to.
Nothing new was learned.
But never mind the symbols.
Think how many discoveries they represent.
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.
Or so we should hope.
Now, what had changed?
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.
"Take no one's word for it."
But that can't be what made the difference.
Authorities had been rejected before, many times.
All knowledge derives from the senses.
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.
Knowledge comes from the senses.
By the way, why don't we do that?
What's wrong with us?
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.
We don't see the origin of species.
But we know about those things.
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction.
The unseen resembles the seen.
And the evidence for evolution?
Some rocks and some finches.
"Ah!" say creationists.
"So you admit it's all interpretation.
No one has ever seen evolution.
You have your interpretation. We have ours.
Yours comes from guesswork, ours from the Bible."
Brains only detect nerve impulses.
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.
It's always, as Karl Popper put it, theory-laden.
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
That myth is testable.
And here is the crucial thing.
There is such a thing as a defect in a story.
Here is one. Persephone wasn't released.
It's equally testable.
Better put that up.
One is well known: untestable theories.
I'd like to start with a little experiment.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
Next step in my process.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.
Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.
In fact, this technology's been evolving.
There are about 30,000 in use now.
And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.
I have a global vision for vision.
But the cost has to be brought right down.
How do you solve this problem?
You start to get into detail.
How do you deal with the industry?
And the answer to that is research.

David Binder: The arts festival revolution
What was this place called Minto?
And he was followed by her little sister.
These festivals are radically open.
They can transform cities and communities.
In short, they make cities better places to live.
I hope you will enjoy.
Oh, you're wiggling your toes.
Maharaja: Nothing to worry about, not a thing.
Paul Nicklen: Tales of ice-bound wonderlands
We didn't even have a telephone.
It's pure white, but it's not a polar bear.
It's a spirit bear, or a Kermode bear.
There are only 200 of these bears left.
They're more rare than the panda bear.
I thought, my career's over.
What in the heck was I thinking?
My clock is ticking. Okay, let's stop.
And what does that mean?
You glaze over with it.
Polar bears are amazing hunters.
There was no ice around.
They're not going to die of hypothermia.
They're going to get to land.
And here's a picture of sick ice.
And here we are diving in the Beaufort Sea.
Here's me in my office.
I hope you appreciate yours.
This is after an hour under the ice.
And so I'm just so happy that the dive is over.
Which means, "Take my camera."
And he thinks I'm saying, "Take my picture."
So we had this little communication breakdown.
This is a bowhead whale.
It could have survived 150 years of whaling.
Alright, my favorite part.
They've got that wryly smile on their mouth.
They look positively prehistoric and a bit scary.
And so people love to form their opinions.
So this is that story.
Oh, and they also happen to eat happy feet.
It doesn't work that way.
This is just the food chain unfolding.
They're not these little harbor seals.
They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.
And they're also curiously aggressive.
I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.
His name is Goran Ehlme from Sweden -- Goran.
And we're trying to not fall in the water.
It's time for you to get in the water."
And now you've got to deliver.
And you can't publish excuses."
And this was the first thing she did.
So that's all I had to work with at that point.
But I just started to shoot these pictures.
She went off, she got a penguin.
The penguin swims toward me, takes off.
Why else would she release these penguins at me?
And so that didn't work.
This went on for four days.
This just didn't happen a couple of times.
But yet she didn't stop.
She would not stop trying to feed me penguins.
And I thought, she's about to bite.
I get emotional. Sorry.
And I'm so passionate about it.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
We all know that it's Bill.
This trait also tells us a lot about politics.
This is from some guy named Ted.
Please raise your hand high right now. OK.
OK, about a -- two dozen.
One, two, three, four, five -- about eight or 10.
OK. This is a bit of a problem.
But I'm here today to give you a choice.
So anyway, let's go with the red pill.
Let's start at the beginning.
What is morality and where does it come from?
The first one is harm/care.
The second foundation is fairness/reciprocity.
The third foundation is in-group/loyalty.
Sports is to war as pornography is to sex.
We get to exercise some ancient, ancient drives.
The fourth foundation is authority/respect.
The fifth foundation is purity/sanctity.
Here are the results.
Same story for fairness.
But look at the other three lines.
For liberals, the scores are very low.
We find this in every country we look at.
Here's the data for 1,100 Canadians.
I'll just flip through a few other slides.
Because liberals like to say, "Fetch, please."
What makes them moral?
Some of you might recognize this as the '60s.
Of course, Bosch called this hell.
The truth of social entropy.
It shoots up and it keeps going up.
It really helps to have some sort of punishment.
The Grand Canyon is really simple.
It's not that complicated.
They say, "Let's question authority."
And they say, "Keep your laws off my body."
Liberals have very noble motives for doing this.
So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
Think about yin and yang.
You find the same thing in Hinduism.
There are many high gods in Hinduism.
You find the same thing in Buddhism.
Can you be not for or against anything?
So, what's the point? What should you do?
No, absolutely not. I'm not saying that.
Think about the Dalai Lama.
So they are able to do it in that sense.
It's essentially a big microwave transmitter.
It's sort of your classic idea of a heat ray.
I could only find these ones.
Victoria? Yes, correct.
That spike was all Victoria.
Hundreds? One, three.
Thousand is getting better.
It was used indiscriminately.
They pumped the whole theater full of the gas.
And in fact, that's exactly what happened here.
But they don't ever get used like that.
She wasn't violent.
Same police district.
I checked the reports on this one.
I looked at it. I was really surprised.
I kid you not. That's exactly what it said.
So why is this relevant?
Dale Dougherty: We are makers
I really believe that.
All of us are makers.
We don't just live, but we make.
It's a scraper bike; it's called -- from Oakland.
They don't always even know why they're doing it.
Guy: I might get one of those.
Dale Dougherty: These are electric muffins.
Guy: Where did you guys get those?
Muffin: Will you glide with us?
We got there first.
Lady: Will you glide with us?
That's the experience of a clever ride.
And of course, we have fashion.
People are remaking things into fashion.
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.
You know what those are, right?
Billy-Bob, or Billy Bass, or something like that.
So, are you a maker?
And again, think about it.
Makers are in control.
They want to use it to their own purpose.
They're not mainstream.
They're a little bit radical.
They're a bit subversive in what they do.
It was not something you'd even remark upon.
And I found this old video.
And I'll tell you more about it, but just ...
Makers and shapers and put-it-togetherers.
It didn't just exist.
We made it, and we were connected to it that way.
And I think that's tremendously important.
This is Andrew Archer.
He liked to take things apart.
And he began building robots.
And that's why he moved to Michigan.
Let me say that again: playing.
It's a micro-controller.
Now here's something -- a 3D printer.
And they do interesting things.
Fascinating work they're doing.
Well he did a little bit better than free.

Eve Ensler: Suddenly, my body
For a long time, there was me, and my body.
Me only existed in the trying.
My body was often in the way.
Me was a floating head.
For years, I actually only wore hats.
It was a way of keeping my head attached.
It was a way of locating myself.
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth.
I did this in front of many strangers.
One night on stage, I actually entered my vagina.
It was an ecstatic experience.
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.
I would drive it and demand things from it.
It had no limits. It was invincible.
I took more than my body had to offer.
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.
Some women became quiet and disappeared.
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.
Then I went somewhere else.
I went outside what I thought I knew.
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I heard stories that got inside my body.
All the stories began to bleed together.
Then I got cancer -- or I found out I had cancer.
Cancer exploded the wall of my disconnection.
Before cancer, the world was something other.
Now I am swimming in it.
And gratefully, it didn't.
And she died quietly in her favorite place.
And she said, "It's for you.
And I said, "But what's the water part?"
And I said, "Of course it is."
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.
It was my whole self melting into Michaela's lap.
It was finally being in my body.
It was the sorrow that's taken so long.
It was the Congolese women who are now rising up.
It was advocating friends and a doting sister.
It was underpaid and really loving nurses.
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.
It was people who came with spells and rituals.
It was a million prayers.
It was a thousand hallelujahs and a million oms.
It was energy, love and joy.
It was all these things.

Rebecca Saxe: How we read each other's minds
I think novelists put this best.
Obviously the whole project here is huge.
This is a picture of it.
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
It's above and behind your right ear.
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
They're MIT undergraduates.
And you know what pirates really like?
Child: Cheese? I love cheese!
I really love cheese sandwiches."
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.
And now, here comes the other pirate.
This pirate is called Joshua.
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
Child: So, that one is his.
RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right.
Child: And then his went on the ground.
RS: That's exactly right.
Child: So he won't know which one is his.
RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
Child: I think he is going to take that one.
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
Which sandwich is he going to take?
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
And he takes this one.
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?
Child: His was on the grass.
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
And I'm going to give that to you now.
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
And we do have such a tool.
So I'm going to show you a demo of this.
Woman : Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes.
It's getting them wrong that is living.
CA: They really are calling?
RS: Yeah, we worry about this.
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
So it's not a surreptitious technology.
RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.
But why does anyone have to feel anything?
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
Carl Honore praises slowness
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.
And I had two questions in my head.
The first was, how did we get so fast?
In other cultures, time is cyclical.
It's seen as moving in great, unhurried circles.
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
You either use it, or lose it.
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.
Time is scarce, so what do we do?
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?
They want to get back to slower rhythms.
I was coming to -- well -- no pun intended there.
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
But why is it so hard to slow down?
I think there are various reasons.
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.
My default mode is no longer to be a rush-aholic.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"
Moshe Safdie on building uniqueness
And it took six months to reroute it.
And finally the building -- this is the model.
Every piece of the building works.
Going back to 1976.
And I felt very troubled.
This voice does not repeat for six months.
I was very moved by what I saw today.
I'd like you to come and design it."
And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."
Within the working drawings!
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.
I'd like to conclude by saying something ...
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.
He who seeks order shall find gratification.
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.
culture,entertainment,jazz,music
Okay, I have no idea what we're going to play.
It is really a sacred space.
You really are alive right here in this moment.
We had no idea what key we were going to play in.
But that could have happened -- maybe, maybe not.
Everyone's listening. We're responding.
You have no time for projected ideas.
Every "mistake" is an opportunity in jazz.
So if Christian played a note -- like play an F.
If you played an E.
And we're going to play on this palette.
And we won't react to it.
It was an opportunity that was missed.
We'll all accept his ideas, or not.
So you see, he played this note.
I ended up creating a melody out of it.
The texture changed in the drums this time.
So there is no mistake.
So jazz, this bandstand is absolutely amazing.
It's a very purifying experience.
You have some people who do.
ready, just play some time.
One, two, one, two, three, four.
This is a science of listening.
Watch. One, two, a one, two, three, four.
It's much more organic. It's much more nuanced.
Asher Hasan's message of peace from Pakistan
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.
My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?
Do I matter, or really exist for you?
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?
I have come from a place of intense darkness.
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.
My name is Papusay.
My heart and drum beat as one.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.
Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.
That was fantastic.
I found that really moving.
It felt like it was really important.
They went through a lot to get here.
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.
So, that's home really.
Capital, Malé, where I live.
And it has been my home these years.
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
That's what brings the monsoon rain.
And then in the winter things cool down.
High pressure builds over India.
And the whole system goes into reverse.
They need fresh water to breed.
They lay the eggs into fresh water.
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
So, they're very important.
They control mosquito larvae, among other things.
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.
It really does need fresh water.
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.
But this guy is an exception.
But it really hasn't been studied very much.
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?
Didn't notice them.
And again I didn't think too much of it.
Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.
So, Maldives, beautiful place.
It's built entirely of coral reefs.
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.
Average height, about that much above sea level.
But I'm not going to talk about that.
So, it stays under the soil.
The trees can put their roots into it.
Humans can dig holes and make a well.
But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.
There is no surface fresh water.
Wait for the go. I'll say go.
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
And I got a bit curious about it.
And there is the answer, 21st of October.
Not every year, that's the average date.
So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
It's going towards India, not from India.
Are they coming from India against the wind?
Seemed a bit unlikely.
So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.
Maldives is a long archipelago.
When do you see the dragonflies appear?
And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.
Far north of Maldives, a bit later.
Then Malé, then further south.
And then the southernmost Maldives.
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
How on Earth are they doing that?
So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.
I had a rigorous scientific transect.
That's not the southwest season.
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
I can be in the southwest monsoon.
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.
What on Earth are they doing?
The larvae have to develop very quickly.
They're up, and they're off.
By September, October, it's drying out.
They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
And then they run out of land.
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
They hatched out in India.
The wind will swoosh them out across here.
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
The rain occurs, these are summer rains.
This is a summer monsoon.
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.
It's only half the length of this one.
A quite incredible feat.
There is more to the story.
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.
So, Siberia, Manchuria.
And that's where it breeds.
It's, well, you can imagine.
But then the being sensible stopped.
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.
No, they turn across here.
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.
It comes with the monsoons.
This time of year they cross back to Africa.
They make use of exactly the same winds.
Same height as the dragonflies go.
So, they are using the same winds.
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.
http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell.html
It's a real pleasure to be here.
I talked about spaghetti sauce.
And so many people, I guess, watch those videos.
And the man's name is Carl Norden.
Carl Norden was born in 1880.
He goes to the Federal Polytech in Zurich.
And he's a Swiss engineer, Carl.
And I mean that in its fullest sense of the word.
It's a complicated physics problem.
It weighs about 50 lbs.
It's called the Norden Mark 15 bombsight.
And he makes this complicated thing.
It was like manna from heaven.
He was simple the instrument of God's will.
And what was God's will?
And what did the Norden bombsight do?
Well it allowed you to do that.
And the box is handcuffed to one of the guards.
It's never allowed to be photographed.
The Norden bombsight is the Holy Grail.
So what happens during the Second World War?
Well, it turns out it's not the Holy Grail.
Secondly, it breaks down a lot.
But of course, what happens in real life?
There are clouds, right.
It needs cloudless sky to be really accurate.
And the chemical plant comprised 757 acres.
10 percent. 10 percent.
So why do we talk about the Norden bombsight?
You know what the answer was?
Zero, not a single one.
Is it because their weapons weren't accurate?
Oh no, they were brilliantly accurate.
Or take the battle in Afghanistan.
It's the drone. What is the drone?
Now what is the accuracy of those drones?
Well it's extraordinary.
But do you know what the crucial thing is?
I have not described to you a success story.
But of course, it didn't matter.
He was a committed Christian.
It would have broken his heart.
Matthieu Ricard on the habits of happiness
This is from Marlboro country.
This is a turquoise lake.
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."
So now, we are going to speak of happiness.
We like the ups and downs of life.
Now, let's come to happiness or well-being.
It is something that -- changes of nature.
That's the nature of things. We get tired.
I can hear it two, three, five times.
It sort of uses itself as you experience it.
Now, what, then, will be happiness?
For you, that might be surprising.
Because we are speaking of a different level.
Look at the waves coming here to shore.
You hit the solid rock.
So now, how is that?
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness.
And isn't that stronger?
So then, this just needs to have some experience.
And we would like to be like that all the time.
For that we have to ask, what is nature of mind?
That is the ground for mind training.
You could go from love to hate.
Benevolence, loving kindness against hatred.
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.
Look at anger itself.
So this is the principal of mind training.
But that's the only way to go.
So can we do that with human qualities?
They are real Olympic champions of mind training.
Now, here with 256 electrodes.
So what did they find? Of course, same thing.
Hopefully, they will come.
Like the startle experiments, for example.
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.
We love to do jogging, fitness.
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful.
That's what we try to do in different places.
Just this one example is worth a lot of work.
One year later, how she is.
And jumping monks of Tibet.

Jackson Browne: "If I Could Be Anywhere"
Spencer Wells builds a family tree for humanity
You see some incredible stuff.
There is so much diversity around the globe.
How do we explain that diversity?
First one is really a question of origins.
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
When did we originate as a species?
How long have we been divergent from each other?
But that's not really the question I'm asking.
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.
How do we study that?
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
You're looking at a great example here.
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?
You think you've got a tough job?
And he did a pretty good job.
But based on what data?
Who were these people who came before?
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
Now, a quick primer on DNA.
Now multiply it by 100.
And imagine copying that by hand.
What's the take-home message?
Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
Such an amazing story.
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.
So the whole world was drying out.
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
Look at some stone tools.
The tool styles don't change that much.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
The population size started to expand.
These would have been savannah hunters.
And it's basically a meat locker.
What do you want to do next?"
The project launched in April 2005.
In this case, you actually can.
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
David Christian: Big history
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.
And that's why that video feels a bit strange.
And yet, look around us.
What we see around us is staggering complexity.
And slightly more complex things appear.
And at each threshold, the going gets tougher.
And that's the story that we tell in big history.
Around us, there's nothing.
There's not even time or space.
And we've crossed our first threshold.
The universe is tiny; it's smaller than an atom.
It's incredibly hot.
And it's expanding at incredible speed.
And all of that happens in the first second.
Now we move forward 380,000 years.
We know above all that it was extremely simple.
They're really a sort of cosmic mush.
But that's not completely true.
And this is how it works.
We have our first stars.
So now the universe is chemically more complex.
Now, the going gets tougher.
I'm talking, of course, about living organisms.
Living organisms are created by chemistry.
We are huge packages of chemicals.
Now, what are the ideal conditions for chemistry?
What are the Goldilocks conditions?
Well, first, you need energy, but not too much.
But not too little.
You'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA.
Each rung contains information.
And DNA also copies itself.
So the information spreads.
And occasionally, there are disasters.
Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago.
Let me explain why.
They accumulate information, they learn.
I call this ability collective learning.
It's what makes us different.
Farming was an energy bonanza.
And that brain is learning at warp speed.
So, here we are, back at the convention center.
I hope you agree that this is a powerful story.
But it also contains warnings.
If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us.
And now, finally, this is what I want.

Shlomo Benartzi: Saving for tomorrow, tomorrow
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
So let's think about how we manage our money.
Let's start with mortgages.
It's kind of a recent topic, at least in the U.S.
And then they foreclose.
We were risk takers, of course.
Then market stocks seize and we're like, "Wow.
How many of you have iPhones?
What if you lose your iPhone?
What if you do this?
How many of you have kids?
I see a lot of hands coming down.
And I know it sounds crazy.
So where does it take us?
We're not doing a great job managing money.
And that's what I really want to focus on today.
I want to address the issue of savings.
And we're going to look at their saving behavior.
They cannot make savings easy.
What about the remaining half of the people?
Some of them elect not to save.
They're just too lazy.
And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.
How many people end up saving to a 401 plan?
One third of Americans.
Two thirds are not saving now.
Are they saving enough?
Take out those who say they save too little.
One out of 10 are saving enough.
Let's look at that.
What are we going to do about it?
That's what I really want to focus on.
Who would go for bananas?
Self-control is not a problem in the future.
Or as some economists call it, present bias.
Wonderful study comparing different countries.
Not many people like checking boxes.
It takes effort. You need to think.
What's the difference?
Well, you still have choice.
Nobody checks boxes.
That's kind of too much effort.
One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.
Doing nothing is very common.
Not many people check boxes.
In Germany, 12 percent check the box.
Twelve percent are organ donors.
In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.
Therefore, 99 percent of people are organ donors.
Inertia, lack of action.
And checking the box takes effort.
They still have an apple left.
They're really mad.
Why have you taken our apple?
This is the notion of loss aversion.
Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.
It's a lot more fun to spend now.
We think we're going to save more next year.
Save More Tomorrow makes it easy.
Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.
Saving more today is not an option.
And here are the results.
It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.
This is a real difference.
It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.
Let me wrap with two key messages.
One is behavioral finance is extremely powerful.
This is just one example.
Message two is there's still a lot to do.
This is really the tip of the iceberg.
The average actually, the record is in Singapore.
