so , what is simplicity ?
they are all very happy .
my son can read a clock .
I suggest we go out for a drink .
there &apos;s no other functions .

don &apos;t do this to me ! it &apos;s not funny !
it &apos;s another way of getting the intuition .
and these are just some of the examples .
what are you interested in ?
it &apos;s your disgusting arrogance that makes you completely insufferable .
it &apos;s a really good thing .
because there is no profit in it .
then I remembered it could be a bunch of things .
they did give me a tour , though .
it &apos;s time for you to get in the water . &quot;
and so here we looked to nature .
everyone looks worried .
I want to talk to you alone .
they hated Tom .
can you show it to me ?
he was a wandering peddler .
why do you want to dress like that ?
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m not plugging T @-@ Mobile .
and I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
we &apos;re trying on these experiences .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
it &apos;s a holy war against Muslims .
you need to be more patient .
and something very unusual happens .
so anyway , we began the journey .
but guess what , nobody will really care .
correct me if I am wrong .
of course , he &apos;d get really bored .
I &apos;m not at work today .
he was my math teacher .
but it &apos;s not really good as a handout .
you can go up , you can go down , right ?
I remember seeing her .
he fired . nothing happened .
I have to study for tomorrow &apos;s French test .
we left Africa forever .

I found the empty box .
and that man told me , &quot; So , here you are .
he is not much better , and there is a little hope of recovery .
they &apos;re not magic . they are not our parents .
and I was thinking , how do I introduce this ?
we can speak only with music .
we &apos;re done .
it &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
go sit in the car .
I &apos;d like to use a safe .
Maluma is on top . yeah . so .
I &apos;m not a monster .
he comes from a small but wealthy town .
this is practically the model of TED .
if the spectators made fun of the other team , then it would weaken their morale .
I &apos;ve come to see Tom .
&quot; the heart of worship is surrender .
that &apos;s where I was born .
nothing makes Tom happy .
I have no words .
that &apos;s great ! I love red wine !
this is just what medicine requires . &quot;
we have to find a way to get that done .
she &apos;s no saint .
what the fuck were you thinking ?
it &apos;s on this side of the brain .
you add the droplet to the system .
I &apos;ll go take a shower now .
it &apos;s in that context that I work .
okay . let &apos;s zoom out again .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the manager .
this is a problem we have to solve .
and he clicks the &quot; buy now &quot; button .
those are actually all real butterfly specimens .
do they arrive at six or seven o &apos;clock ?
do I have a chase boat ?
pardon me , but that is my racket .
it &apos;s not very good . it &apos;s cluttered .
and so we started to analyze why .
sounds like a pretty good idea , after all .
it almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day .
I was trapped in a vicious circle .
just think about how you &apos;d feel in a similar situation .
and then backtrack innovations within that .

we rented an apartment when we lived in New York .
and of course , they were right .
I have difficulty concentrating .
the chicken hasn &apos;t laid eggs lately .
it &apos;s totally dominated by work .
who are you texting ?
the students disobeyed their teacher .
&quot; Oh , so you really want to go to school here ?
I accept where we are .
and that &apos;s exactly what we were aiming for .
a little better than nature .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
so , in a sense , you get what you pay for .
voice : look at my smile .
at seventy , my father is still very active .
this man &apos;s ramblings are the furthest from the truth I &apos;ve ever heard !
when I see this picture , I &apos;m reminded of our holiday .

I &apos;ve already filled out the form .
Milo &apos;s Mom : that carpet is brand new .

I &apos;ll stay involved .
I designed it .
and we &apos;re going to help him with this now .
it &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
on the whole human beings want to be good , but not too good and not quite all the time .
they were in that room with me all night .
they really tell us what &apos;s going on there .
she has gone too far .
adventure , entertainment , global issues , oceans
but this is a global phenomenon , we know that .
there was no swelling .
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic .
and unfortunately , I can be a little too honest .
he moves quickly .
we &apos;re under attack !
that three @-@ year @-@ old boy is still part of you .
you can &apos;t own your children .
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up .
and he comes to the town . he &apos;s a broken person .
now , I know you don &apos;t believe me , really , here .

I have nothing to say about that .
okay , they &apos;re a little inchoate .
he fancies himself ill .
and they changed the atmosphere .
I saw you with him .
now I &apos;m making it available to schools .
I want to show you two examples .
Tom found that a little bit odd .
so this is where the mouse came from as well .
kids don &apos;t do it because someone told them to .
the judgement went against the government .
I think we were lucky .
most people say women .
this is a permanent magnet .
can I pay later ?
dinner &apos;s ready .
the beauty of that is you never miss a call .
they just switched , that was it .

it could not be something you experienced .
man proposes , God disposes .

left @-@ wing communism is an infantile disorder .
we must feed three billion people in cities .
I went in to see her .
none of those things were stirring .
I admire Tom &apos;s perseverance .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
she doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
finish drinking your milk .
attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder .
you remember to talk all five culture stages .
you &apos;re unambitious .
no one &apos;s watching .
so it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
if you &apos;d listen , you &apos;d understand .
but after the riot , it &apos;s too much difference .
the circumstances gave color to her story .
how is it that they do that ?
I &apos;ve been walking on crutches ever since I broke my foot .
so exactly why did China grow so much faster ?

there &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
this is one of the students , Khaled Hamdan .
I pleaded not guilty .
do circuses still have freak shows ?
she scrubbed the kitchen floor with a brush .
and here &apos;s a video of Joseph .
and we &apos;ll go off and have a conversation on that .
and this is exactly what you expected , isn &apos;t it ?
this is as messy as it gets .
I think it &apos;s very likely that they &apos;ll arrive next week .
Mapping and tagging .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
&quot; damn it ! why Jack ? why ? &quot;
some people say that the theory of evolution is &quot; only &quot; a theory but a scientific theory is something that has been proven to be true .

the fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
I &apos;m not prepared to do that yet .
and it &apos;s used for conflict resolution .
and our long @-@ lived mutants are too .
I must find out who is behind this .
just observe your cat and you will get to know him .
like a leaf in the autumn breeze .
but as we age , our organs tend to fail more .

they are approaching .
this is for you .
this is a smile on the face of a Bonobo .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
that &apos;s just what we were going for .
and they do interesting things .
it &apos;s there someone you can trust ?
don &apos;t read my journal .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
there is something called pit lamping .
I like that shirt .
so , book writing is the same thing .
and he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
why are you flinching ?
we should all work together .
there &apos;s a black hole at the center of our galaxy .
now you prepare for the inevitable .
I didn &apos;t know you had a dog .
that &apos;s a little diver up there in the corner .
this is Nell Remmel .
bill , call me tonight .
I said , I also have a pottery .
pleased to meet you .
and I want to tell you how this gun can help .
I want to challenge you today .
Tom knew what Mary had done .
both black holes are getting closer together .
Tom is repairing his car .
I &apos;ve done a really stupid thing .
she &apos;s never said that , maybe you &apos;re mistaken .
so they would come up with all these ideas .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
painting is another thing I can do fairly well .
he looked up at the ceiling .
I &apos;ll ride shotgun .
so it wasn &apos;t about symmetry .
how can it be that mathematics , being after all a product of human thought independent of experience , is so admirably adapted to the objects of reality ?
she is forty years old .
now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
why can &apos;t I hear ?
a whole new symmetry .
they set out for New York .
Apparently , there is nothing that cannot happen today .
they didn &apos;t like this at all .
I often go downtown on Sunday .
she made him rich .
Tom thought that Mary was asleep .
I want to trust you .
without you I am nothing .

now , let me make a fast replay of Botswana .
no , agile aerial robots like this one .
did you see that ?
am I being accused of murder ?
and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know , actually . &quot;

he lied about his age .
that kind of makes sense to us .
what is it made of ?
everybody praised Ken for his great courage .
I know your problem .
it &apos;s in the forefront of your mind always .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
in that case , the consequences are rather severe .
and I was one of those people .
I said , okay , and she sat down , and we talked .
Chris Anderson : Sendhil , thank you so much .
I washed my hands .
in essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
the verdict was a bitter pill to swallow .
they also pollute their next @-@ door neighbors .
and we &apos;re trying to not fall in the water .
there &apos;s a good person .
Tom didn &apos;t leave Mary .
in times of crisis one should never idealise the past .
it turns out to be very important .
so it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
you &apos;ve bought more stamps than necessary .
he is stronger than me .
this is an incredibly rugged machine .
he has three sons .
does it bother you if I smoke ?

the kind with the corrugated roof , you know .
Tom has volunteered to help us .
you must do it at once .
the beautiful thing is that it moves bodily .

I &apos;ll get there before you .
we are the majority .
you are in part responsible for it .

I think I &apos;ve had a little too much to drink .
and what &apos;s the magic with them ?
I mean , is there something wrong with you ? &quot;
are you busy Friday night ?
I can &apos;t solve this problem .
we discussed it last night .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
and just put radially they &apos;re going out that way .
and we have window farms all over the world .
Tom shows his camera to his brother .
this is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere .
I have grapes .
okay . left to right ?

&quot; what &apos;s happening ? , &quot; murmured a voice from the other end of the room .
at last , the end @-@ of @-@ term exams are over .
it &apos;s not polite to stare at others .
Tom has sold his house in Boston .
some people get less dressed up .
they ruined it .
it would help and bring attention .
they &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
that &apos;s me at my desk .
I feel like I might throw up .
maybe Tom will give me a job .
what time is it over there ?
and these are two projections from the world .
and I started walking off .
you &apos;re not safe here .
because I know our brains are resilient .
but e @-@ miles follow Moore &apos;s Law .
she treated me badly .
we passed by the pharmacy before coming home .
so , I &apos;m pretty pleased with it all .
and they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
I had to give Tom time to think about it .
no , the DNA tells a story that &apos;s very clear .
and we need to train them right .

that &apos;s my colleague . he &apos;s let it go .
there were no problems .
and the floppy disk drive person wears it .
well , there do seem to be a few .
how did I look ?
she paused and said , &quot; He models things . &quot;
it will be despairing hostility .
where there is no conflict , trade flourishes .
that fox must have killed the hen .
because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
is Tom a witness ?
one is behavioral finance is extremely powerful .
I don &apos;t have the authority to give you permission .
seen from a distance , it looks like a ball .
my dog won &apos;t bite you , unless you ask for it .
this is ... does somebody know ?
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
and so what we &apos;re looking for is that gene .
Luckily the door was open .
you are interrupting the lesson .
and when you start , you cannot stop .
being run over is never easy .

Representatives from many countries have participated in this conference .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is honest .

Tom puts too much sugar in his tea .
so we &apos;re based in New York City .
this book is much more useful than that one .
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that .
all they needed was labor .
first , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
I think Tom can do that .
how do I tell my parents that I &apos;m pregnant ?

you remind me of myself when I was your age .
the train left before I arrived at the station .
a friend of mine asked me to send her a postcard .
that would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint .
the cops are looking for the gang &apos;s hideout .
a crowd was gathering around him .

I &apos;m not making it up .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
